<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>

<p>Some portions of this book have already appeared in
print. Of these, the most important is the <i>catalogue
raisonné</i> of early Norman castles in England which will
be found in <a href="#CHAPTER_VII">Chapter VII</a>., and which was originally
published in the <i>English Historical Review</i> (vol. xix.,
1904). It has, however, been enlarged by the inclusion
of five fresh castles, and by notes upon thirty-four others,
of which the article in the <i>Review</i> gave only the names;
the historical notes in that essay being confined to the
castles mentioned in Domesday Book.</p>

<p>The <a href="#CHAPTER_XI">chapter on Irish mottes</a> appeared in the
<i>Antiquary</i> (vol. xlii., 1906), but it has been revised,
corrected, and added to. Portions of a still earlier
paper, read before the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland
in March 1900, are incorporated in various parts of
the book, but these have been recast in the fuller treatment
of the subject which is aimed at here.</p>

<p>The rest of the work is entirely new. No serious
attempt had been made to ascertain the exact nature
of Saxon and Danish fortifications by a comparison of
the existing remains with the historical records which
have come down to us, until the publication of Mr
Allcroft&rsquo;s valuable book on <i>Earthwork of England</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
The chapters on <a href="#CHAPTER_II">Saxon</a> and <a href="#CHAPTER_IV">Danish</a> earthworks in the
present volume were written before the appearance of his
book, though the results arrived at are only slightly
different.</p>

<p>In <a href="#CHAPTER_V">Chapter V</a>. an effort is made to trace the first
appearance of the private castle in European history.
The private castle is an institution which is often carelessly
supposed to have existed from time immemorial.
The writer contends that it only appears after the
establishment of the feudal system.</p>

<p>The favourable reception given by archæologists to
the paper read before the Scottish Society led the writer
to follow up this interesting subject, and to make a
closer study of the motte-castles of Wales, Scotland, and
Ireland. The book now offered is the fruit of eleven
years of further research. The result of the inquiry is
to establish the theory advanced in that earlier paper,
that these castles, in the British Islands, are in every
case of Norman origin.</p>

<p>The writer does not claim to have originated this
theory. Dr Round was the first to attack (in the
<i>Quarterly Review</i>, 1894) the assertion of the late Mr
G. T. Clark that the moated mound was a Saxon castle.
Mr George Neilson continued the same line of argument
in his illuminating paper on &ldquo;The Motes in Norman
Scotland&rdquo; (<i>Scottish Review</i>, vol. xxxii., 1898).<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> All that
the writer claims is to have carried the contention a
stage further, and to have shown that the private castle
did not exist at all in Britain until it was brought here
by the Normans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span></p>

<p>The author feels that some apology is necessary for
the enormous length of <a href="#CHAPTER_VII">Chapter VII</a>., containing the
catalogue of Early English castles. It may be urged in
extenuation that much of the information it contains has
never before appeared in print, seeing that it has been
taken from unpublished portions of the Pipe Rolls;
further, that contemporary authorities have in all cases
been used, and that the chapter contains a mass of
material, previously scattered and almost inaccessible,
which is here for the first time collated, and placed, as
the author thinks, in its right setting. It is hoped that
the chapter will prove a useful storehouse to those who
are working at the history of any particular castle
mentioned in the list.</p>

<p>To many it may seem a waste of labour to devote a
whole book to the establishment of a proposition which
is now generally adopted by the best English archæologists;
but the subject is an important one, and there
is no book which deals with it in detail, and in the light
of the evidence which has recently been accumulated.
The writer hopes that such fuller statement of the case
as is here attempted may help not only to a right ascription
of British castle-mounds, and of the stone castles
built upon many of them, but may also furnish material
to the historian who seeks to trace the progress of the
Norman occupation.</p>

<p>Students of the architecture of castles are aware that
this subject presents much more difficult questions than
does the architecture of churches. Those who are
seriously working on castle architecture are very few in
number, and are as yet little known to the world at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
large. From time to time, books on castles are issued
from the press, which show that the writers have not
even an idea of the preliminary studies without which
their work has no value at all. It is hoped that the
sketch of castle architecture from the 10th century to
the 13th, which is given in the <a href="#CHAPTER_XII">last chapter</a>, may prove a
useful contribution to the subject, at any rate in its lists
of dated castles. The Pipe Rolls have been too little
used hitherto for the general history of castle architecture,
and no list has ever been published before of the
keeps built by Henry II. But without the evidence of
the Pipe Rolls we are in the land of guesswork, unsupported,
as a rule, by the decorative details which render
it easy to read the structural history of most churches.</p>

<p>My warmest thanks are due to Mr Duncan H.
Montgomerie, F.S.A., for his generous labour on the
plans and illustrations of this book, and for effective
assistance in the course of the work, especially in many
toilsome pilgrimages for the purpose of comparing the
Ordnance Survey with the actual remains. I also owe
grateful thanks to Mr Goddard H. Orpen, R.I.A., for
most kindly revising the <a href="#CHAPTER_XI">chapter on Irish mottes</a>; to
Mr W. St John Hope (late Assistant Secretary of the
Society of Antiquaries), for information on many difficult
points; to Mr Harold Sands, F.S.A., whose readiness
to lay his great stores of knowledge at my disposal
has been always unfailing; to Mr George Neilson,
F.S.A.Scot., for most valuable help towards my <a href="#CHAPTER_X">chapter
on Scottish mottes</a>; to Mr Charles Dawson, F.S.A.,
for granting the use of his admirable photographs from
the Bayeux Tapestry; to Mr Cooper, author of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
<i>History of York Castle</i>, for important facts and documents
relating to his subject; to the Rev. Herbert
White, M.A., and to Mr Basil Stallybrass, for reports
of visits to castles; and to correspondents too numerous
to mention who have kindly, and often very fully,
answered my inquiries.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_EARLY_NORMAN_CASTLES_OF" id="THE_EARLY_NORMAN_CASTLES_OF">THE EARLY NORMAN CASTLES OF
THE BRITISH ISLES</a></h2>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a><br />
<span class="smaller">INTRODUCTORY</span></h2>

<p>The study of earthworks has been one of the most
neglected subjects in English archæology until quite
recent years. It may even be said that during the first
half of the 19th century, less attention was paid to
earthworks than by our older topographical writers.
Leland, in the reign of Henry VIII., never failed to
notice the &ldquo;Dikes and Hilles, which were Campes of
Men of Warre,&rdquo; nor the &ldquo;Hilles of Yerth cast up like
the Dungeon of sum olde Castelle,&rdquo; which he saw in
his pilgrimages through England. And many of our
17th- and 18th-century topographers have left us invaluable
notices of earthworks which were extant in their
time. But if we turn over the archæological journals
of some fifty years ago, we shall be struck by the
paucity of papers on earthworks, and especially by the
complete ignoring, in most cases, of those connected
with castles.</p>

<p>The misfortune attending this neglect, was that it
left the ground open to individual fancy, and each
observer formed his own theory of the earthworks
which he happened to have seen, and as often as not,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
stated that theory as a fact. We need not be surprised
to find Camden doing this, as he wrote before the dawn
of scientific observation; but that such methods should
have been carried on until late in the 19th century is
little to the credit of English archæology. Mr Clark&rsquo;s
work on <i>Mediæval Military Architecture</i> (published in
1884), which has the merit of being one of the first to
pay due attention to castle earthworks, counterbalances
that merit by enunciating as a fact a mere guess of his
own, which, as we shall afterwards show, was absolutely
devoid of solid foundation.</p>

<p>The scientific study of English earthworks may be
said to have been begun by General Pitt-Rivers in the
last quarter of the 19th century; but we must not
forget that he described himself as a pupil of Canon
Greenwell, whose careful investigations of British
barrows form such an important chapter of prehistoric
archæology. General Pitt-Rivers applied the lessons
he had thus learned to the excavation of camps and
dykes, and his labours opened a new era in that branch
of research. By accumulating an immense body of
observations, and by recording those observations with
a minuteness intended to forestall future questions, he
built up a storehouse of facts which will furnish
materials to all future workers in prehistoric antiquities.
He was too cautious ever to dogmatise, and if he
arrived at conclusions, he was careful to state them
merely as suggestions. But his work destroyed many
favourite antiquarian delusions, even some which had
been cherished by very learned writers, such as Dr
Guest&rsquo;s theory of the &ldquo;Belgic ditches&rdquo; of Wiltshire.</p>

<p>A further important step in the study of earthworks
was taken by the late Mr I. Chalkley Gould, when he
founded the Committee for Ancient Earthworks, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
drew up the classification of earthworks which is now
being generally adopted by archæological writers. This
classification may be abridged into (<i>a</i>) promontory or
cliff forts, (<i>b</i>) hill forts, (<i>c</i>) rectangular forts, (<i>d</i>) moated
hillocks, (<i>e</i>) moated hillocks with courts attached, (<i>f</i>)
banks and ditches surrounding homesteads, (<i>g</i>) manorial
works, (<i>h</i>) fortified villages.</p>

<p>We venture to think that still further divisions are
needed, to include (1) boundary earthworks; (2) sepulchral
or religious circles or squares; (3) enclosures
clearly non-military, intended to protect sheep and
cattle from wolves, or to aid in the capture of wild
animals.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>This classification, it will be observed, makes no
attempt to decide the dates of the different types of
earthworks enumerated. But a great step forward was
taken when these different types were separated from
one another. There had been no greater source of
confusion in the writings of our older antiquaries, than
the unscientific idea that one earthwork was as good
as another; that is to say, that one type of earthwork
would do as well as another for any date or any circumstances.
When it is recognised that large classes of
earthworks show similar features, it becomes probable
that even if they were not thrown up in the same
historic period, they were at any rate raised to meet
similar sets of circumstances. We may be quite sure
that a camp which contains an area of 60 or 80 acres
was not constructed for the same purpose as one which
only contains an area of three.</p>

<p>We are not concerned here, however, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
attempt to disentangle the dates of the various classes
of prehistoric earthworks.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Such generalisations are
for the most part premature; and although some advance
is being made in this direction, it is still impossible to
decide without excavation whether a camp of class (<i>a</i>)
or (<i>b</i>) belongs to the Stone Age, the Bronze Age, or
the Iron Age. Our business is with classes (<i>d</i>) and (<i>e</i>)
of Mr Gould&rsquo;s list, that is, with the moated hillocks.
We shall only treat of the other classes to the extent
which is necessary to bring out the special character of
classes (<i>d</i>) and (<i>e</i>).</p>

<p>Let us look more closely into these earthworks in
their perfect form, the class (<i>e</i>) of the Earthwork
Committee&rsquo;s list. They consist, when fully preserved,
of an artificial hillock, 20, 30, 40, or in some rare
instances 100 feet high. The hillock carried a breastwork
of earth round the top, which in many cases is
still preserved; this breastwork enclosed a small court,
sometimes only 30 feet in diameter, in rare cases as large
as half an acre; it must have been crowned by a
stockade of timber, and the representations in the
Bayeux Tapestry would lead us to think that it always
enclosed a wooden tower.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> As a rule the hillock is
round, but it is not unfrequently oval, and occasionally
square. The base of the hillock is surrounded by a
ditch. Below the hillock is a court, much larger than
the small space enclosed on the top of the mount. It
also has been surrounded by a ditch, which joins the
ditch of the mount, and thus encloses the whole fortification.
The court is defended by earthen banks, both on
the scarp and counterscarp of the ditch, and these banks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
of course had also their timber stockades, the remains of
which have sometimes been found on excavation.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>These are the main features of the earthworks in
question. Some variations may be noticed. The
ditch is not invariably carried all round the hillock,
occasionally it is not continued between the hillock and
the court.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Sometimes the length of the ditch separating
the hillock from the court is at a higher level than
the main ditch.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Often the ditches were evidently dry
from the first, but not infrequently they are wet, and
sometimes vestiges of the arrangements for feeding
them are still apparent. The hillock is not invariably
artificial; often it is a natural hill scarped into a conical
shape; sometimes an isolated rock is made use of to
serve as a citadel, which saved much spade-work. The
shape of the court is very variable: it may be square or
oblong, with greatly rounded corners, or it may be oval,
or semilunar, or triangular; a very common form is the
bean-shaped. The area covered by these fortifications
is much more uniform; one of the features contrasting
them most strongly with the great prehistoric &ldquo;camps&rdquo;
of southern England is their comparatively small size.
We know of only one (Skipsea) in which the bailey
covers as much as eight acres; in by far the greater
number the whole area included in the hillock, court,
and ditches does not exceed three acres, and often it is
not more than one and a half.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Now this type of fort will tell us a good deal about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
itself if we examine it carefully. In the first place,
its character is more pronounced than that of any other
class of earthwork. It differs entirely from the great
camps which belong to the tribal period. It was
evidently not designed to accommodate a mass of people
with their flocks and herds. It is small in area, and
its citadel, as a rule, is very small indeed. Dr Sophus
Müller, the eminent Danish archæologist, when dealing
with the specimens of this class of fortification which
are to be found in Denmark, made the luminous remark
that &ldquo;the fortresses of prehistoric times are the
defences of the <i>community</i>, north of the Alps as in the
old classical lands. Small castles for an individual and
his warrior-band belong to the Middle Ages.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> These
words give the true direction to which we must turn for
the interpretation of these earthworks.</p>

<p>In the second place, this type presents a peculiar
development of plan, such as we do not expect to find
in the earliest times in these islands. It has a citadel of
a most pronounced type. This alone differentiates it
from the prehistoric or Keltic camps which are so
abundant in Great Britain. It might be too hasty a
generalisation to say that no prehistoric camps have
citadels, but as a rule the traverses by which some of
these camps are divided appear to have been made for
the purpose of separating the cattle from the people,
rather than as ultimate retreats in time of war. The
early German camps, according to Köhler, have inner
enclosures which he thinks were intended for the
residence of the chief; but he calls attention to the great
difference between these camps and the class we are now
considering, in that the inner enclosure is of much
greater size.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> It would appear that some of the fortifica<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>tions
in England which are known or suspected to be
Saxon have also these inner enclosures of considerable
size (6 acres in the case of Witham), but without any
vestige of the hillock which is the principal feature of
class (<i>e</i>).</p>

<p>It is clear, in the third place, that the man who
threw up earthworks of this latter class was not only
suspicious of his neighbours, but was even suspicious of
his own garrison. For the hillock in the great majority
of cases is so constructed as to be capable of complete
isolation, and capable of defending itself, if necessary,
against its own court. Thus it is probable that the
force which followed this chieftain was not composed of
men of his own blood, in whom he could repose absolute
trust; and the earthworks themselves suggest that they
are the work of an invader who came to settle in these
islands, who employed mercenaries instead of tribesmen,
and who had to maintain his settlement by force.</p>

<p>When on further inquiry we find that earthworks of
this type are exceedingly common in France, and are
generally found in connection with feudal castles,<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and
when we consider the area of their distribution in the
United Kingdom, and see that they are to be found in
every county in England, as well as in Wales and in the
Normanised parts of Ireland and Scotland, we see that
the Norman invader is the one to whom they seem to
point. We see also that small forts of this kind, easily
and cheaply constructed, and defensible by a small
number of men, exactly correspond to the needs of the
Norman invader, both during the period of the Conquest
and for a long time after his first settlement here.</p>

<p>But it will at once occur to an objector that there
have been other invaders of Britain before the Normans,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
and it may be asked why these earthworks were not
equally suited to the needs of the Saxon or the Danish
conquerors, and why they may not with equal reason be
attributed to them. To answer this question we will try
to discover what kind of fortifications actually were
constructed by the Saxons and Danes, and to this
inquiry we will address ourselves in the succeeding
chapters.</p>

<p>It will clear the ground greatly if it is recognised at
the outset that these earthworks are <i>castles</i>, in the
usual sense of the word; that is, the private fortified
residences of great landowners. It was the chief merit
of Mr G. T. Clark&rsquo;s work on <i>Mediæval Military
Architecture</i>, that he showed the perfect correspondence
in plan of these earthen and timber structures with
the stone castles which immediately succeeded them,
so that it was only necessary to add a stone tower
and stone walls to these works to convert them into
a Norman castle of the popularly accepted type. We
regard the military character of these works as so
fully established that we have not thought it necessary to
discuss the theory that they were temples, which was
suggested by some of our older writers, nor even the
more modern idea that they were moot-hills, which
has been defended with considerable learning by Mr
G. L. Gomme.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Dr Christison remarks in his valuable
work on Scottish fortifications that an overweening
importance has been attached to moot-hills, without
historical evidence.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> And Mr George Neilson, in his
essay on &ldquo;The Motes in Norman Scotland&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> (to which
we shall often have occasion to refer hereafter), shows that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
moot-hill in Scotland means nothing but mote-hill, the
hill of the mote or <i>motte</i>; but that <i>moots</i> or courts were
held there, just because it had formerly been the site
of a castle, and consequently a seat of jurisdiction.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>That some of these hillocks have anciently been
sepulchral, we do not attempt to deny. The Norman
seems to have been free from any superstitious fear
which might have hindered him from utilising the
sepulchres of the dead for his personal defence; or else
he was unaware that they were burial-places. There
are some very few recorded instances of prehistoric
burials found under the hillocks of castles; but in
ordinary cases, these hillocks would not be large enough
for the <i>mottes</i> of castles.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> There are, however, some
sepulchral barrows of such great size that it is difficult
to distinguish them from mottes; the absence of a
court attached is not sufficient evidence, as there are
some mottes which stand alone, without any accompanying
court. Excavation or documentary evidence can
alone decide in these cases, though the presence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
an earthen breastwork on top of the mount furnishes
a strong presumption of a military origin. But the
undoubtedly sepulchral barrows of New Grange and
Dowth in Ireland show signs of having been utilised
as castles, having remains of breastworks on their
summits.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br />
<span class="smaller">ANGLO-SAXON FORTIFICATIONS</span></h2>

<p>We have pointed out in the preceding chapter that
when it is asked whether the earthworks of the moated
mound-and-court type were the work of the Anglo-Saxons,
the question resolves itself into another, namely,
Did the Anglo-Saxons build castles?</p>

<p>As far as we know, they did not; and although
to prove a negative we can only bring negative evidence,
that evidence appears to us to be very conclusive. But
before we deal with it, we will try to find out what sort
of fortifications the Anglo-Saxons actually did construct.</p>

<p>The first fortification which we read of in the <i>Anglo-Saxon
Chronicle</i> is that of Bamborough, in Northumberland.
The <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i> tells us that in
547 Ida began to reign in Northumberland, and adds
that he built &ldquo;Bebbanburh,&rdquo; which was first enclosed
with a hedge, and afterwards with a wall. Unfortunately
this celebrated passage is merely the interpolation
of a 12th-century scribe, and is consequently of no
authority whatever,<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> though there is nothing improbable
in the statement, and it is supported by Nennius.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
Ida&rsquo;s grandson Ethelfrith gave this fortress to his wife
Bebba, from whom it received the name of Bebbanburh,
now Bamborough. It was built without doubt on the
same lofty insulated rock where the castle now stands;
for when it was attacked by Penda in 633, he found the
situation so strong that it was impossible to storm it,
and it was only by heaping up wood on the most
accessible side that he was able to set fire to the wooden
stockade.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Modern historians talk of this fort as a
castle, but all the older authorities call it a town;<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> nor
is there any mention of a castle at Bamborough till the
reign of William II. The area of the basaltic headland
of Bamborough covers 4&frac34; acres, a site large enough for
a city of Ida&rsquo;s day. The church of St Peter was placed
on the highest point. The castle which was built there
in Norman times does not seem to have occupied at
first more than a portion of this site,<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> though it is
probable that eventually the townsmen were expelled
from the rock, and that thus the modern town of
Bamborough arose in the levels below. Although 4&frac34;
acres may seem a small size for an <i>urbs</i>, it was certainly
regarded as such, and was large enough to protect a
considerable body of invaders.</p>

<p>Strange to say, this is the only record which we
have of any fortress-building by the invading Saxons.
Until we come to the time of Alfred, there is hardly an
allusion to any fortification in use in Saxon times.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
is mentioned in 571 that the Saxons took four towns
(<i>tunas</i>) of the Britons, and the apparent allusion to
sieges seems to show that these British towns had some
kind of fortification. The three <i>chesters</i>, which were
taken by the Saxons in 577, Gloucester, Cirencester,
and Bath, prove that some Roman cities still kept their
defences. In 755 the slaughter of Cynewulf, king of
the West Saxons, by the etheling Cyneard, is told with
unusual detail by the <i>Chronicle</i>. The king was slain
in a <i>bur</i> (bower, or isolated women&rsquo;s chamber<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>), the door
of which he attempted to defend; but this <i>bur</i> was itself
enclosed in a <i>burh</i>, the gates of which were locked by
the etheling who had killed the king, and were defended
until they were forced by the king&rsquo;s avengers. Here it
seems to be doubtful whether the <i>burh</i> was a town or a
private enclosure resembling a stable-yard of modern
times. The description of the storming of York by the
Danes in 867 shows that the Roman walls of that city
were still preserved. These passages are the solitary
instances of fortifications in England mentioned by the
<i>Chronicle</i> before the time of Alfred.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> The invasions of
the Danes led at last to a great fortifying epoch, which
preserved our country from being totally overwhelmed
by those northern immigrants.</p>

<p>The little Saxon kingdom of Wessex was the germ
of the British Empire. When Alfred came to the throne
it had already absorbed the neighbouring kingdoms of
Kent, Sussex, and Surrey, and the issue hanging in the
balance was whether this small English state would
survive the desolating flood of pagan barbarism which
had already overwhelmed the sister kingdoms of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
Midlands and the North. It was given to Alfred to
raise again the fallen standard of Christendom and
civilisation, and to establish an English kingdom on so
sound a basis that when, in later centuries, it successively
became the prey of the Dane and the Norman,
the English polity survived both conquests. The
wisdom, energy, and steadfastness of King Alfred and
his children and grandchildren were amongst the most
important of the many factors which have helped to
build up the great empire of Britain.</p>

<p>We are concerned here with only one of the measures
by which Alfred and his family secured the triumph of
Wessex in her mortal struggle with the Danes, the
fortifications which they raised for the protection of
their subjects. From the pages of the <i>Anglo-Saxon
Chronicle</i> we might be led to think that Alfred&rsquo;s son
and daughter, Edward and Ethelfleda, were the chief
builders of fortifications. But there is ample evidence
that they only carried out a systematic purpose which
had been initiated by Alfred. We know that Alfred
was a great builder. &ldquo;What shall I say,&rdquo; cries Asser,
&ldquo;of the cities and towns which he restored, and of
others which he built which had never existed before!
Of the royal halls and chambers, wonderfully built of
stone and wood by his command!&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> The <i>Anglo-Saxon
Chronicle</i> notices the restoration of London (886),<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> about
which two extant charters are more precise.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> It also
mentions the building of a work (geweorc) at Athelney,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
and another at Limene-muthan (doubtless a repair of the
Roman fort at Lympne), and two works built by Alfred
on the banks of the river Lea.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> William of Malmesbury
tells us that in his boyhood there was a stone in the
nunnery of Shaftesbury which had been taken out of
the walls of the town, which bore this inscription:
&ldquo;Anno dominicæ incarnationis Alfredus rex fecit hanc
urbem, DCCCLXXX, regni sui VIII.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Ethelred,
Alfred&rsquo;s son-in-law, built the <i>burh</i> at Worcester in
Alfred&rsquo;s lifetime, as a most interesting charter tells us.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>It may be safely assumed, then, that when Edward
came to the throne he found Wessex well provided with
defensive places, and that when he and his sister
signalised their conquests in the Midlands by building
strongholds at every fresh step of their advance, they
were only carrying out the policy of their father.</p>

<p>At the time of Alfred&rsquo;s death, and the succession of
Edward the Elder to the crown (901), Ethelfleda,
daughter of Alfred, was the wife of Ethelred, ealdorman
of Mercia, who appears to have been a sort of under-king
of that province.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> On the death of Ethelred in
912,<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Edward took possession of London and Oxford
and &ldquo;of all the lands which owed obedience thereto&rdquo;&mdash;in
other words, of that small portion of Eastern Mercia
which was still in English hands; that is, not only the
present Oxfordshire and Middlesex, but part of Herts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
part of Bedfordshire, all Buckinghamshire, and the
southern part of Northants. The Watling Street,
which runs north-west from London to Shrewsbury, and
thence north to Chester and Manchester, formed at that
time the dividing line between the English and Danish
rule.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> It would seem from the course of the story that
after Ethelred&rsquo;s death there was some arrangement
between Ethelfleda and her brother, possibly due to the
surrender of the territory mentioned above, which
enabled her to rule English Mercia in greater independence
than her husband had enjoyed. Up to this date
we find Edward disposing of the <i>fyrd</i> of Mercia;<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> this
is not mentioned again in Ethelfleda&rsquo;s lifetime. Nothing
is clearer, both from the <i>Chronicle</i> and from Florence,
than that the brother and sister each &ldquo;did their own,&rdquo;
to use an expressive provincial phrase. Ethelfleda goes
her own way, subduing Western Mercia, while Edward
pushes up through Eastern Mercia and Essex to
complete the conquest of East Anglia. A certain
concert may be observed in their movements, but they
did not work in company.</p>

<p>The work of fortification begun in Alfred&rsquo;s reign had
been continued by the restoration of the Roman walls of
Chester in 908, by Ethelred and his wife; and Ethelfleda
herself (possibly during the lingering illness which later
chroniclers give to her husband) had built a <i>burh</i> at
Bremesbyrig. During the twelve years which elapsed
between Ethelred&rsquo;s death and that of Edward in 924, the
brother and sister built no less than twenty-seven <i>burhs</i>,
giving a total of thirty, if we add Chester and Bremesbyrig,
and Worcester, which was built in Alfred&rsquo;s reign. Now
what was the nature of these fortifications, which the
<i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i> uniformly calls <i>burhs</i>?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>There is really not the slightest difficulty in answering
this question. The word is with us still; it is our word
<i>borough</i>. It is true we have altered the meaning somewhat,
because a borough means now an enfranchised
town; but we must remember that it got that meaning
because the fortified towns, the only ones which were
called <i>burhs</i> or <i>burgi</i>, were the first to be enfranchised,
and while the fortifications have become less and less
important, the franchise has become of supreme
importance.</p>

<p>Bede, in the earliest times of our history, equated
<i>burh</i> with <i>urbs</i>, a city; Alfred in his <i>Orosius</i> translates
<i>civitas</i> by <i>burh</i>;<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> the Anglo-Saxon gospels of the 11th
century do the same;<a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> and the confederacy of five
Danish towns which existed in Mercia in the 10th
century is called in contemporary records <i>fif burga</i>, the
five boroughs.<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p><i>Burh</i> is a noun derived from the word <i>beorgan</i>, to
protect. Undoubtedly its primitive meaning was that
of a <i>protective enclosure</i>. As in the case of the words
<i>tun</i>, <i>yard</i>, or <i>garth</i>, and <i>worth</i> or <i>ward</i>, the sense of the
word became extended from the protecting bulwark to
the place protected. In this sense of a <i>fortified
enclosure</i>, the word was naturally applied by the Anglo-Saxons
to the prehistoric and British &ldquo;camps&rdquo; which
they found in Britain, such as Cissbury. Moreover, it is
clear that some kind of enclosure must have existed
round every farmstead in Saxon times, if only as a
protection against wolves. The illustrated Saxon manuscripts
show that the hall in which the thane dwelt, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
ladies&rsquo; bower, the chapel and other buildings dependent
on the hall, were enclosed in a stockade, and had gates
which without doubt were closed at night.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> This
enclosure may have been called a <i>burh</i>, and the innumerable
place-names in England ending in <i>borough</i> or <i>bury</i><a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
seem to suggest that the <i>burh</i> was often nothing more
than a stockade, as in so many of these sites not a
vestige of defensive works remains.<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> We may concede
that the original meaning of an <i>enclosure</i> was never
entirely lost, and that it appears to be preserved in a few
passages in the Anglo-Saxon laws. Thus Edmund
speaks of <i>mine burh</i> as an asylum, the violation of which
brings its special punishment; and Ethelred II. ordains
that every compurgation shall take place in <i>thaes
kyninges byrig</i>; and the <i>Rectitudines Singularum
Personum</i> tells us that one of the duties of the geneat
was to build for his lord, and to hedge his <i>burh</i>.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> But
it is absolutely clear that even in these cases a <i>burh</i> was
an enclosure and not a tump; and it is equally clear
from the general use of the word that its main meaning
was a <i>fortified town</i>. Athelstan ordains that there shall
be a mint in every <i>burh</i>; and his laws show that already
the <i>burh</i> has its <i>gemot</i> or meeting, and its <i>reeve</i> or
mayor.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> He ordains that all <i>burhs</i> are to be repaired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
fourteen days after Rogations, and that no market shall
be held outside the town.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> In the laws of Edgar&rsquo;s time
not only the borough-moot and the borough-reeve are
spoken of, but the <i>burh-waru</i> or burgesses.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> <i>Burh</i> is
contrasted with wapentake as town with country.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<div id="Fig_2" class="figure"><div class="subfigure">

</div></div>
<div class="caption">Fig. 2.&mdash;Anglo-Saxon MS. of Prudentius.</div>

<p>If we wish to multiply proofs that a <i>burh</i> was the
same thing as a borough, we can turn to the Anglo-Saxon
illustrated manuscripts, and we shall find that
they give us many pictures of <i>burhs</i>, and that in all cases
they are fortified towns.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Finally, Florence of Worcester,
one of the most careful of our early chroniclers, who
lived when Anglo-Saxon was still a living language, and
who must have known what a <i>burh</i> meant, translates it
by <i>urbs</i> in nineteen cases out of twenty-six.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> His authority
alone is sufficient to settle this question, and we need
no longer have any doubt that a <i>burh</i> was the same thing
which in mediæval Latin is called a <i>burgus</i>, that is a
fortified town, and that our word <i>borough</i> is lawfully
descended from it.</p>

<p>It would not have been necessary to spend so much
time on the history of the word <i>burh</i> if this unfortunate
word had not been made the subject of one of the
strangest delusions which ever was imposed on the
archæological world. We refer of course to the theory
of the late Mr G. T. Clark, who contended in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
<i>Mediæval Military Architecture</i><a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> that the moated mound
of class (<i>e</i>), which we have described in our first chapter,
was what the Anglo-Saxons called a <i>burh</i>. In other
words, he maintained that the burhs were Saxon
castles. It is one of the most extraordinary and inexplicable
things in the history of English archæology
that a man who was not in any sense an Anglo-Saxon
scholar was allowed to affix an entirely new meaning
to a very common Anglo-Saxon word, and that this
meaning was at once accepted without question by
historians who had made Anglo-Saxon history their
special study! The present writer makes no pretensions
to be an Anglo-Saxon scholar, but it is easy to pick out
the word <i>burh</i> in the <i>Chronicle</i> and the Anglo-Saxon
<i>Laws</i>, and to find out how the word is translated in the
Latin chronicles; and this little exercise is sufficient in
itself to prove the futility of Mr Clark&rsquo;s contention.</p>

<p>Sentiment perhaps had something to do with Mr
Clark&rsquo;s remarkable success. There is an almost utter
lack of tangible monuments of our national heroes; and
therefore people who justly esteemed the labours of
Alfred and his house were pleased when they were told
that the mounds at Tamworth, Warwick, and elsewhere
were the work of Ethelfleda, and that other mounds
were the work of Edward the Elder. It did not occur
to them that they were doing a great wrong to the
memory of the children of Alfred in supposing them
capable of building these little earthen and timber castles
for their personal defence and that of their nobles, and
leaving the mass of their people at the mercy of the
Danes. Far other was the thought of Ethelfleda, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
she and her husband built the borough of Worcester.
As they expressed it in their memorable charter, it was
not only for the defence of the bishop and the churches
of Worcester, but &ldquo;<span class="smcap">To Shelter all the Folk</span>.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> And
we may be sure that the same idea lay at the founding of
all the boroughs which were built by Alfred and by
Edward and Ethelfleda. They were to be places where
the whole countryside could take refuge during a Danish
raid. The <i>Chronicle</i> tells us in 894 how Alfred divided
his forces into three parts, the duty of one part being
to defend the boroughs; and from this time forth we
constantly find the men of the boroughs doing good
service against the Danes.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> It was by defending and
thus developing the boroughs of England that Alfred
and his descendants saved England from the Danes.</p>

<p>Thus far we have seen that all the fortifications
which we know to have been built by the Anglo-Saxons
were the fortifications of society and not of the individual.
We have heard nothing whatever of the private castle
as an institution in Saxon times; and although this
evidence is only negative, it appears to us to be entitled
to much more weight than has hitherto been given to it.
Some writers seem to think that the private castle was
a modest little thing which was content to blush unseen.
This is wholly to mistake the position of the private
castle in history. Such a castle is not merely a social
arrangement, it is a political institution of the highest
importance. Where such castles exist, we are certain to
hear of some of them, sooner or later, in the pages of
history.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>We can easily test this by comparing Anglo-Saxon
history with Norman of the same period, after castles
had arisen in Normandy. Who among Saxon nobles
was more likely to possess a castle than the powerful
Earl Godwin, and his independent sons? Yet when
Godwin left the court of Edward the Confessor, because
he would not obey the king&rsquo;s order to punish the men
of Dover for insulting Count Eustace of Boulogne, we
do not hear that he retired to his castle, or that his
sons fortified their castles against the king; we only
hear that they met together at Beverstone (a place where
there was no castle before the 14th century)<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> and
&ldquo;arrayed themselves resolutely.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> Neither do we hear
of any castle belonging to the powerful Earl Siward of
Northumbria, or Leofric, Earl of Mercia. And when
Godwin returned triumphantly to England in 1052 we
do not hear of any castles being restored to him.</p>

<p>Now let us contrast this piece of English history, as
told by the <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i>, with the Norman
history of about the same period, the history of the
rebellion of the Norman nobles against their young
duke, William the Bastard. The first thing the nobles
do is to put their castles into a state of defence.
William has to take refuge in the castle of a faithful
vassal, Hubert of Rye, until he can safely reach his own
castle of Falaise. After the victory of Val-ès-Dunes,
William had to reduce the castles which still held out,
and then to order the destruction of all the castles which
had been erected against him.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>Or let us contrast the <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i> of
1051 with that of 1088, when certain Norman barons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
and bishops in England conspired against the new king,
William Rufus. The first thing told us is that each of
the head conspirators &ldquo;went to his castle, and manned
it and victualled it.&rdquo; Then Bishop Geoffrey makes
Bristol Castle the base of a series of plundering raids.
Bishop Wulfstan, on the other hand, aids the cause of
William by preventing an attempt of the rebels on the
castle of Worcester. Roger Bigod throws himself into
Norwich Castle, and harries the shire; Bishop Odo
brings the plunder of Kent into his castle of Rochester.
Finally the king&rsquo;s cause wins the day through the taking
of the castles of Tonbridge, Pevensey, Rochester, and
Durham.</p>

<p>If we reflect on the contrast which these narratives
afford, it surely is difficult to avoid the conclusion that
if the chronicler never mentions any Saxon castles it is
because there were no Saxon castles to mention. Had
Earl Godwin possessed a stronghold in which he could
fortify himself, he would certainly have used it in 1051.
And as the Norman favourites of Edward the Confessor
had already begun to build castles in England, we can
imagine no reason why Godwin did not do the same,
except that such a step was impossible to a man who
desired popularity amongst his countrymen. The
Welshmen, we are told (that is the foreigners, the
Normans), had erected a castle in Herefordshire among
the people of Earl Sweyn, and had wrought all possible
harm and disgrace to the king&rsquo;s men thereabout.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> The
language of the <i>Chronicle</i> shows the unpopularity, to
say the least of it, of this castle-building; and one of
the conditions which Godwin, when posing as popular
champion, wished to exact from the king, was that the
<i>Frenchmen who were in the castle</i> should be given up to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
him.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> When Godwin returned from his exile, and the
Normans took to flight, the chronicler tells us that
some fled west to Pentecost&rsquo;s castle, some north to
Robert&rsquo;s castle. Thus we learn that there were several
castles in England belonging to the Norman favourites.</p>

<p>It is in connection with these Norman favourites
that the word <i>castel</i> appears for the first time in the
<i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i>. This is a fact of considerable
importance in itself; and when we weigh it in connection
with the expressions of dislike recorded above
which become much more explicit and vehement after
the Norman Conquest, we cannot but feel that Mr
Freeman&rsquo;s conclusion, that the thing as well as the word
was new, is highly probable.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> For the hall of the Anglo-Saxon
ealdorman or thane, even when enclosed in an
earthwork or stockade, was a very different thing from
the castle of a Norman noble. A castle is built by a
man who lives among enemies, who distrusts his nearest
neighbours as much as any foe from a distance. The
Anglo-Saxon noble had no reason to distrust his
neighbours, or to fortify himself against them. Later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
historians, who were familiar with the state of things in
Norman times, tell us frequently of castles in the Saxon
period; but it can generally be proved that they misunderstood
their authorities. The genuine contemporary
chroniclers of Saxon times never make the slightest
allusion to a Saxon castle.</p>

<p>The word <i>castellum</i>, it is true, appears occasionally
in Anglo-Saxon charters, but when it is used it clearly
means a town. Thus Egbert of Kent says in 765:
&ldquo;Trado terram intra castelli m&oelig;nia supranominati, id
est Hrofescestri, unum viculum cum duobus jugeribus,
etc.,&rdquo; where <i>castellum</i> is evidently the city of Rochester.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
Offa calls Wermund &ldquo;episcopus castelli quod nominatur
Hroffeceastre.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> These instances can easily be
multiplied. Mr W. H. Stevenson remarks that &ldquo;in
Old-English glosses, from the 8th century Corpus
Glossary downwards, <i>castellum</i> is glossed by <i>wic</i>, that
is town.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> In this sense no doubt we must interpret
Asser&rsquo;s &ldquo;castellum quod dicitur Werham.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> Henry of
Huntingdon probably meant a town when he says that
Edward the Elder built at Hertford &ldquo;castrum non
immensum sed pulcherrimum.&rdquo; He generally translates
the <i>burh</i> of the <i>Chronicle</i> by <i>burgus</i>, and he shows
that he had a correct idea of Edward&rsquo;s work when he
says that at Buckingham Edward &ldquo;fecit <i>vallum</i>
ex utraque parte aquæ&rdquo;&mdash;where <i>vallum</i> is a translation
of <i>burh</i>. The difference between a <i>burh</i> and a castle
is very clearly expressed by the <i>Chronicle</i> in 1092, when
it says concerning the restoration of Carlisle on its
conquest by William Rufus, &ldquo;He repaired the borough
(burh) and ordered the castle to be built.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>The following is a table of the thirty boroughs built
by Ethelfleda and Edward, arranged chronologically,
which will show that we never find a <i>motte</i>, that is a
moated mound, on the site of one of these boroughs
unless a Norman castle-builder has been at work there
subsequently. The weak point in Mr Clark&rsquo;s argument
was that when he found a motte on a site which had
once been Saxon, he did not stop to inquire what any
subsequent builders might have done there, but at once
assumed that the motte was Saxon. Of course, if we
invariably found a motte at <i>every</i> place where Edward
or Ethelfleda are said to have built a <i>burh</i>, it would
raise a strong presumption that mottes and burhs were
the same thing. But out of the twenty-five burhs which
can be identified, in only ten is there a motte on the
same site; and in every case where a motte is found,
except at Bakewell and Towcester, there is recorded
proof of the existence of a Norman castle. In this list,
the <i>burhs</i> on both sides of the river at Hertford,
Buckingham, and Nottingham are counted as two,
because the very precise indications given in the <i>Anglo-Saxon
Chronicle</i> show that each <i>burh</i> was a separate
construction.</p>

<p>Out of this list of the <i>burhs</i> of Ethelfleda and
Edward, thirteen are mentioned as boroughs in
Domesday Book;<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> and as we ought to subtract five
from the list as unidentified, and also to reckon as one
the boroughs built on two sides of the river, the whole
number should be reduced to twenty-two. So that
more than half the boroughs built by the children of
Alfred continued to maintain their existence during the
succeeding centuries, and in fact until the present day.
But the others, for some reason or other, did not take
root. Professor Maitland remarked that many of the
boroughs of Edward&rsquo;s day became rotten boroughs
before they were ripe;<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> and it is a proof of the difficulty
of the task which the royal brethren undertook that,
with the exception of Chester, none of the boroughs
which they built in the north-western districts survived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
till Domesday. In all their boroughs, except Bakewell,
the purpose of defending the great Roman roads and
the main waterways is very apparent.</p>

<p>Our list is very far from being a complete list of all
the Anglo-Saxon boroughs existing in Edward&rsquo;s day.
In the document known as the &ldquo;Burghal Hidage&rdquo; we
have another quite different list of thirty-two boroughs,<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
which, according to Professor Maitland, &ldquo;sets forth
certain arrangements made early in the 10th century for
the defence of Wessex against the Danish inroads.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
Five at least on the list are Roman chesters; twenty
are mentioned as boroughs in Domesday Book. There
are two among them which are of special interest,
because there is reason to believe that the earthen
ramparts which still surround them are of Saxon origin:
Wallingford and Wareham. Both these fortifications
are after the Roman pattern, the earthen banks forming
a square with rounded corners.<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> See <a href="#Fig_3">Fig. 3</a>.</p>

<p>To complete our knowledge of Anglo-Saxon fortification,
we ought to examine the places mentioned in
Anglo-Saxon charters as royal seats, where possibly
defensive works of some kind may have existed.
Unfortunately we are unable to learn that there are
any such works, except at one place, Bensington in
Oxfordshire, where about a hundred years ago &ldquo;a bank
and trench, which seem to have been of a square form,&rdquo;
were to be seen.<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>In the following chapter we shall deal in detail with
such archæological remains as still exist of the boroughs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
of Edward and Ethelfleda, but here we will briefly
summarise by anticipation the results to which that
chapter will lead. We see that sites defensible by
nature were often seized upon for fortification, as at
Bamborough, Bridgenorth, and Eddisbury; but that
this was by no means always the case, as a weak site,
such as Witham, for example, was sometimes rendered
defensible by works which appear to have fulfilled their
purpose. In only one case (Witham) do we find an
inner enclosure; and as it is of large size (9&frac12; acres) it
is more probable that the outer enclosure was for cattle,
than that the inner one was designed solely for the
protection of the king and his court. We are not told
of stone walls more than once (at Towcester); but the
use of the word <i>timbrian</i>, which does not exclusively
mean to build in wood,<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> does not preclude walls of
stone in important places. In the square or oblong
form, with rounded corners, we see the influence which
Roman models exercised on eyes which still beheld
them existing.</p>

<p>We see that the main idea of the borough was the
same as that of the prehistoric or British &ldquo;camp of
refuge,&rdquo; in that it was intended for the defence of
society and not of the individual. It was intended to
be a place of refuge for the whole countryside. But it
was also something much more than this, something
which belongs to a much more advanced state of
society than the hill-fort.<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> It was a town, a place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
where people were expected to live permanently and do
their daily work. It provided a fostering seat for trade
and manufactures, two of the chief factors in the history
of civilisation. The men who kept watch and ward on
the ramparts, or who sallied forth in their bands to fight
the Danes, were the men who were slowly building up
the prosperity of the stricken land of England. By
studding the great highways of England with fortified
towns, Alfred and his children were not only saving the
kernel of the British Empire, they were laying the sure
foundations of its future progress in the arts and habits
of civilised life.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br />
<span class="smaller">ANGLO-SAXON FORTIFICATIONS&mdash;<i>continued</i></span></h2>

<p>The bare list which we have given of the boroughs of
Edward and Ethelfleda calls for some explanatory
remarks. Let us take first the boroughs of Ethelfleda.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Worcester.</span>&mdash;We have already noticed the charter
of Ethelred and Ethelfleda which tells of the building of
the burh at Worcester.<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> There appears to have been a
small Roman settlement at Worcester, but there is no
evidence that it was a fortified place.<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> This case lends
some support to the conjecture of Dr Christison, that
the Saxons gave the name of <i>chester</i> to towns which
they had themselves fortified.<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> The mediæval walls of
Worcester were probably more extensive than Ethelfleda&rsquo;s
borough, of which no trace remains.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chester</span> is spoken of by the <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i>
in 894 as &ldquo;a waste <i>chester</i> in Wirral.&rdquo; It had undoubtedly
been a Roman city, and therefore the work
of Ethelred and Ethelfleda here was solely one of
restoration. Brompton, who wrote at the close of the
13th century &ldquo;a poor compilation of little authority,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
was the first writer to state that the walls of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
Chester were enlarged by Ethelfleda so as to take in
the castle, which he fancied to be Roman;<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> and this
statement, being repeated by Leland, has acquired considerable
vogue. It is very unlikely that any extension
of the walls was made by the Mercian pair, seeing that
the city was deserted at the time when it was occupied
by the Danes, only fourteen years before. But it is
quite certain that the Norman castle of Chester lay
outside the city walls, as the manor of Gloverstone, which
was not within the jurisdiction of the city, lay between
the city and the castle.<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> A charter of Henry VII.
shows that the civic boundary did not extend to the
present south wall in his reign. Ethelfleda&rsquo;s borough
probably followed the lines of the old Roman castrum.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bremesbyrig.</span>&mdash;This place has not yet been identified.
Bromborough on the Mersey has been suggested,
and is not impossible, for the loss of the <i>s</i> sometimes
occurs in place-names; thus Melbury, in Wilts, was
Melsburie in Domesday. Bremesbyrig was the first
place restored after Chester, and as the estuary of the
Dee had been secured by the repair of Chester, so an
advance on Bromborough would have for its aim to
secure the estuary of the Mersey. It was outside the
Danish frontier of Watling Street, and could thus be
fortified without breach of the peace in 911. There is
a large moated work at Bromborough, enclosing an area
of 10 acres, in the midst of which stands the courthouse
of the manor of Bromborough. But this manor was
given by the Earl of Chester to the monks of St<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
Werburgh about 1152, and it is possible that the monks
fortified it, as they did their manor of Irby in Wirral,
against the incursions of the Welsh. One of the
conditions of the Earl&rsquo;s grant was that the manor is
to be maintained in a state of security and convenience
for the holding of the courts appertaining to Chester
Abbey.<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> Thus the fortification appears to be of
manorial use, though this does not preclude the possibility
of an earlier origin. On the other hand, if
Bromborough is the same as Brunanburh, where
Athelstan&rsquo;s great battle was fought (and there is much
in favour of this), it cannot possibly have been
Bremesbyrig in the days of Edward. Another site
has been suggested by the Rev. C. S. Taylor, in a
paper on <i>The Danes in Gloucestershire</i>, Bromsberrow in
S. Gloucestershire, one of the last spurs of the Malvern
Hills. Here the top of a small hill has been encircled
with a ditch; but the ditch is so narrow that it does not
suggest a defensive work, and it is remote from any
Roman road or navigable river.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scergeat</span> has not yet been identified. Mr Kerslake
argued with some probability that Shrewsbury is the
place;<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> but the etymological considerations are adverse,
and it is more likely that such an important place as
Shrewsbury was fortified before Edward&rsquo;s time. Leland
calls it Scorgate, and says it is &ldquo;about Severn side.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
It should probably be sought within the frontier of
Watling Street, which Ethelfleda does not appear to
have yet crossed in 911.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bridgenorth</span> is undoubtedly the Bricge of the
<i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i>, as Florence of Worcester
identifies it with the Bridgenorth which Robert Belesme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
fortified against Henry I. in 1101.<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> Bridgenorth is on
a natural fortification of steep rock, which would only
require a stout wall to make it secure against all the
military resources of the 10th century. We may therefore
be quite certain that it was here Ethelfleda planted
her borough, and not (as Mr Eyton unfortunately
conjectured) on the mound outside the city, in the
parish of Oldbury.<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> This mound was far more probably
the site of the siege castle (no doubt of wood)
which was erected by Henry I. when he besieged the
city.<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tamworth</span> was an ancient city of the Mercian kings,
and therefore may have been fortified before its walls
were rebuilt by Ethelfleda.<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> The line of the ancient
town-wall can still be traced in parts, though it is
rapidly disappearing. Dugdale says the town ditch
was 45 feet broad. Tamworth was a borough at the
time of Domesday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stafford</span> has a motte on which stood a Norman
castle; but this is not mentioned in the table, because it
stands a mile and a half from the town on the <i>southern</i>
side of the river Sowe, while we are expressly told by
Florence that Ethelfleda&rsquo;s borough was on the <i>northern</i>
side, as the town is now. Stafford was a Domesday<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
borough; some parts of the mediæval walls still remain.
The walls are mentioned in Domesday Book.<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eddisbury</span>, in Cheshire (<a href="#Fig_4">Fig. 4</a>), is the only case
in which the work of Ethelfleda is preserved in a
practically unaltered form, as no town or village has ever
grown out of it. The <i>burh</i> stands at the top of a hill,
commanding the junction of two great Roman roads, the
Watling Street from Chester to Manchester, and the
branch which it sends forth to Kinderton on the east.
As a very misleading plan of this work has been
published in the <i>Journal of the British Archæological
Association</i> for 1906, the <i>burh</i> has been specially surveyed
for this book by Mr D. H. Montgomerie, who
has also furnished the following description:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This plan is approximately oval, and is governed by
the shape of the ground; the work lies at the end of a
spur, running S.E. and terminating in abrupt slopes to
the E. and S. The defences on the N. and W. consist
of a ditch and a high outer bank, the proportions of
these varying according to the slope of the hill. There
are slight remains of a light inner rampart along the
western half of this side. The remains of an original
entrance (shown in Ormerod&rsquo;s <i>Cheshire</i>) are visible in
the middle of the N.W. side, beyond which the ditch
and outer bank have been partially levelled by the
encroachments of the farm buildings. The defences of
the S. side seem to have consisted of a long natural
slope, crowned by a steeper scarp, cut back into the
rock, and having traces of a bank along its crest. The
S.E. end of the spur presents several interesting details,
for it has been occupied in mediæval times by a small
fortified enclosure, whose defences are apt to be confused
with those of the older Saxon town. The rock makes a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
triangular projection at this end, containing the foundations
of mediæval buildings,<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> and strengthened on the
N.E. by a slight ditch some 7 to 10 feet below the crest;
the rock on the inner side of this ditch has been cut back
to a nearly vertical face, while on the outer bank are
the footings of a masonry wall extending almost to the
point of the spur. There are traces of another wall
defending the crest on the N.E. and S.; but the
base of the triangle, facing the old enclosure, does not
appear to have been strengthened by a cross ditch or
bank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may be noted that this enclosure presents not the
slightest appearance of a motte. It is at a lower level
than the body of the hill, and belongs most certainly to
the Edwardian period of the masonry buildings.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 4.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Warwick</span> Castle has a motte which has been
confidently attributed to Ethelfleda, only because
Dugdale copied the assertion of Thomas Rous, a very
imaginative writer of the 15th century, that she was its
builder. The borough which Ethelfleda fortified probably
occupied a smaller area than the mediæval walls
built in Edward I.&rsquo;s reign; and it is probable that it did
not include the site of the castle, as Domesday states
that only four houses were destroyed when the castle
was built.<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> The borough was doubtless erected to
protect the Roman road from Bath to Lincoln, the Foss
Way, which passes near it. Domesday Book, after
mentioning that the king&rsquo;s barons have 112 houses in
the borough, and the abbot of Coventry 36, goes on to
say that these houses belong to the lands which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
barons hold outside the city, and are rated there.<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> This
is one of the passages from which the late Professor
Maitland concluded that the boroughs planted by
Ethelfleda and Edward were organised on a system of
military defence, whereby the magnates in the country
were bound to keep houses in the towns.<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cyricbyrig.</span>&mdash;About this place we adopt the conjecture
of Dugdale, who identified it with Monk&rsquo;s Kirby in
Warwickshire, not far from the borders of Leicestershire,
and therefore on the edge of Ethelfleda&rsquo;s dominions.
It lies close to the Foss Way, and about three miles from
Watling Street; like Eddisbury, it is near the junction
of two Roman roads. There are remains of banks and
ditches below the church. Dugdale says &ldquo;there are
certain apparent tokens that the Romans had some
station here; for by digging the ground near the church,
there have been discovered foundations of old walls and
Roman bricks.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> Possibly Ethelfleda restored a Roman
castrum here. At any rate, it seems a much more likely
site than Chirbury in Shropshire, which is commonly
proposed, but which does not lie on any Roman road,
and is not on Ethelfleda&rsquo;s line of advance; nor are there
any earthworks there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Weardbyrig</span> has not been identified. Wednesbury
was stated by Camden to be the place,<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> and but for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
impossibility of the etymology, the situation would suit
well enough. Weardbyrig must have been an important
place, for it had a mint.<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> Warburton, on the Mersey,
has been gravely suggested, but is impossible, as it takes
its name from St Werburgh.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Runcorn</span> has not a vestige to show of Ethelfleda&rsquo;s
borough; but local historians have preserved some rather
vague accounts of a promontory fort which once existed
at the point where the London and North-Western
Railway bridge enters the river. A rocky headland
formerly projected here into the Mersey, narrowing its
course to 400 yards at high water; a ditch with a
circular curve cut off this headland from the shore.
This ditch, from 12 to 16 feet wide, with an inner bank
6 or 7 feet high, could still be traced in the early part of
the 19th century. Eighteen feet of the headland were
cut off when the Duke of Bridgewater made his canal in
1773, and the ditch was obliterated when the railway
bridge was built. From the measurements which have
been preserved, the area of this fort must have been very
small, not exceeding 3 acres at the outside;<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> and it is
unlikely that it represented Ethelfleda&rsquo;s borough, as the
church, which was of pre-Conquest foundation, stood
outside its bounds, and we should certainly have
expected to find it within. As the Norman earls of
Chester established a ferry at Runcorn in the 12th
century, and as a castle at Runcorn is spoken of in a
mediæval document,<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> it seems not impossible that there
may have been a Norman castle on this site, as we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
constantly find such small fortifications placed to defend
a ferry or ford. It is probable that Ethelfleda&rsquo;s borough
was destroyed at an early period by the Northmen, for
Runcorn was not a borough at Domesday, but was then
a mere dependency of the Honour of Halton.</p>

<h3><i>The Burhs of Edward the Elder.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Hertford.</span>&mdash;Two burhs were built by Edward at
Hertford in 913, one on the north and the other on the
south side of the river Lea. Therefore if a burh were
the same thing as a motte, there ought to be two mottes
at Hertford, one on each side of the river; whereas there
is only one, and that forms part of the works of the
Norman castle. Mr Clark, with his usual confidence,
says that the northern mound has &ldquo;long been laid
low&rdquo;;<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> but there is not the slightest proof that it ever
existed except in his imagination. Hertford was a
borough at the time of Domesday. No earthworks
remain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witham</span> (<a href="#Fig_4">Fig. 4</a>).&mdash;There are some remains of a
<i>burh</i> here which are very remarkable, as they show an
inner enclosure within the outer one. They have been
carefully surveyed by Mr F. C. J. Spurrell, who has
published a plan of them.<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> Each enclosure formed
roughly a square with much-rounded corners. The
ditch round the outer work was 30 feet wide; the inner
work was not ditched. The area enclosed by the outer
bank was 26&frac14; acres, an enclosure much too large for a
castle; the area of the inner enclosure was 9&frac12; acres.
As far as is at present known, Witham is the only
instance we have of an Anglo-Saxon earthwork which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
has a double enclosure.<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> Witham is not mentioned as
a borough in Domesday Book, but the fact that it had
a mint in the days of Hardicanute shows that it
maintained its borough rights for more than a hundred
years. The name Chipping Hill points to a market
within the borough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Buckingham</span> is another case where a <i>burh</i> was built
on both sides of the river, and as at Hertford, there
was only one motte, site of the castle of the Norman
Giffards, now almost obliterated. The river Ouse
here makes a long narrow loop to the south-west,
within which stands the town, and, without doubt,
this would be the site of Edward&rsquo;s borough. No trace
is left of the second borough on the other side of
the river. Buckingham is one of the boroughs of
Domesday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bedford</span> has had a motte and a Norman castle on
the north side of the Ouse; but this was not the site of
Edward&rsquo;s borough, which the <i>Chronicle</i> tells us was placed
on the south side of that river. On the south side an
ancient ditch, 10 or 12 feet broad, with some traces of
an inner rampart, semicircular in plan, but with a square
extension, is still visible, and fills with water at flood
times.<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> This is very likely to be the ditch of Edward&rsquo;s
borough. Both at Bedford and Buckingham the
<i>Chronicle</i> states that Edward spent four weeks in building
the <i>burh</i>. Mediæval numbers must never be taken
as precise; but the disproportion between four weeks
and eight days, the space often given for the building
of an early Norman castle, corresponds very well to the
difference between the time needed to throw up the bank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
and stockade of a town, and that needed for the building
of an earthen and wooden castle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maldon.</span>&mdash;Only one angle of the earthen bank of
Edward&rsquo;s borough remains now, but Gough states
that it was an oblong camp enclosing about 22 acres.<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>
It had rounded corners and a very wide ditch, with a
bank on both scarp and counterscarp. Maldon was a
borough at Domesday;<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> the king had a hall there, but
there was never any castle, nor is there any trace of a
motte.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Towcester</span> (<a href="#Fig_5">Fig. 5</a>).&mdash;There is a motte at Towcester,
but no direct evidence has yet been found for the
existence of a Norman castle there, though Leland says
that he was told of &ldquo;certen Ruines or Diches of a
Castelle.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> There was a mill and an oven to which
the citizens owed soke,<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> and the value of the manor,
which belonged to the king, had risen very greatly since
the Conquest;<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> all facts which render the existence of a
Norman castle extremely likely. But there can be no
question as to the nature of Edward&rsquo;s work at Towcester,
as the <i>Chronicle</i> tells us expressly that &ldquo;he wrought the
burgh at Towcester with a stone wall.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> Towcester lies
on Watling Street, and is believed to have been the
Roman station of Lactodorum. Baker gives a plan of
the remains existing in his time, which may either be
those of the Roman castrum or of Edward&rsquo;s borough.<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>
The area is stated to be about 35 acres.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wigingamere.</span>&mdash;This place is not yet identified, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
the identification with Wigmore in Herefordshire, though
accepted by many respectable writers, will not stand a
moment&rsquo;s examination. Wigmore was entirely out of
Edward&rsquo;s beat, and he had far too much on his hands
in 918 to attempt a campaign in Herefordshire. As
Wigingamere appears to have specially drawn upon
itself the wrath of East Anglian and Essex Danes, it
must have lain somewhere in their neighbourhood. The
<i>mere</i> which is included in the name would seem to point
to that great inland water which anciently stretched
southwards from the Wash into Cambridgeshire. The
only approach to East Anglia from the south lay along
a strip of open chalk land which lay between the great
swamp and the dense forests which grew east of it.<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
Here ran the ancient road called the Icknield way. On
a peninsula which now runs out into the great fens of
the Cam and the Ouse there is still a village called
Wicken, 6 miles west of the Roman road; and possibly,
when the land surrounding this peninsula was under
water, this bight may have been called Wigingamere.
This suggestion of course is merely tentative, but what
gives it some probability is that the Danish army which
attacked &ldquo;the borough at Wigingamere&rdquo; came from
East Anglia as well as Mercia.<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 5.&mdash;Plan of Towcester about 1830.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Huntingdon.</span>&mdash;The borough of Huntingdon was
probably first built by the Danes, as it was only
repaired by Edward. In Leland&rsquo;s time there were still
some remains of the walls &ldquo;in places.&rdquo; Huntingdon is
one of the <i>burgi</i> of Domesday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colchester.</span>&mdash;This of course was a Roman site, and
Edward needed only to restore the walls, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
<i>Chronicle</i> indicates. Colchester was placed so as to
defend the river Colne, just as Maldon defended the
estuary of the Blackwater. As the repair of Colchester
and the successful defence of Wigingamere were
followed the same year by the submission of East
Anglia, it seems not unlikely that Edward&rsquo;s various
forces may have made a simultaneous advance, along
the coast, and along the Roman road by the Fen
country; but this of course is the merest conjecture, as
the <i>Chronicle</i> gives us no details of this very important
event.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cledemuthan.</span>&mdash;This place is only mentioned in the
Abingdon MS. of the <i>Chronicle</i>, but the year 921 is the
date given for its building. This date should probably
be transposed to 918, the year in which, according to
Florence, Edward subjugated East Anglia. It is well
known how confused the chronology of the various
versions of the <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i> is during the
reign of Edward the Elder.<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> Cley, in Norfolk, would
be etymologically deducible from Clede (the <i>d</i> being
frequently dropped, especially in Scandinavian districts),
and the <i>muthan</i> points to some river estuary. Cley is
one of the few havens on the north coast of Norfolk,
and its importance in former times was much greater
than now, as is shown not only by the spaciousness of
its Early English church, but by the fact that the port
has jurisdiction for 30 miles along the coast.<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> It would
be highly probable that Edward completed the subjugation
of East Anglia by planting a borough at some
important point. But as the real date of the fortifica<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>tion
of Cledemuthan is uncertain, we must be content to
leave this matter in abeyance.<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stamford</span> is another case where the <i>borough</i> is
clearly said to have been on the side which is opposite
to the one where the Norman castle stands. Edward&rsquo;s
borough was on the south side, the motte and other
remains of the Norman castle are on the north of the
Welland. It is remarkable that the part of Stamford
on the south side of the Welland is still a distinct
liberty; it is mentioned in Domesday as the sixth ward
of the borough. The line of the earthworks can still be
traced in parts. The borough on the north side of the
Welland was probably first walled in by the Danes, as
it was one of the Five Boroughs&mdash;Stamford, Leicester,
Lincoln, Nottingham, and Derby&mdash;which appear to have
formed an independent or semi-independent state in
middle England.<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> Stamford is a borough in Domesday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nottingham.</span>&mdash;The first mention of a fortress in
connection with Nottingham seems to suggest that it
owed its origin to the Danes. In 868 the Danish host
which had taken possession of York in the previous
year &ldquo;went into Mercia to Nottingham, and there took
up their winter quarters. And Burgræd king of Mercia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
and his Witan begged of Ethelred, king of the West
Saxons, and of Alfred his brother, that they would help
them, that they might fight against the army. And
then they went with the West Saxon force into Mercia
as far as Nottingham, and there encountered the army
which was in the fortress (geweorc), and besieged them
there; but there was no great battle fought, and the
Mercians made peace with the army.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> Nottingham
became another of the Danish Five Boroughs. The
Danish host on this occasion came from York, no doubt
in ships down the Ouse and up the Trent. The site
would exactly suit them, as it occupied a very strong
position on St Mary&rsquo;s Hill, a height equal to that on
which the castle stands, defended on the south front by
precipitous cliffs, below which ran the river Leen, and
only a very short distance from the junction of the Leen
with the Trent, the great waterway of middle England.<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>
Portions of the ancient ditch were uncovered in 1890, and
its outline appears to have been roughly rectangular, like
the Danish camp at Shoebury. The ditch was about
20 feet wide. The area enclosed was about 39 acres.</p>

<p>This borough was captured by Edward the Elder
in 919, when after the death of his sister Ethelfleda he
advanced into Danish Mercia, taking up the work
which she had left unfinished.<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> The <i>Chronicle</i> tells us
that he repaired the borough (burh), and garrisoned it
with both English and Danes. Two years later, he
evidently felt the necessity of fortifying the Trent
itself, for he built another borough on the south side of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
the river, and connected the two boroughs by a bridge,
which must have included a causeway or a wooden
stage across the marshes of the Leen. It is not surprising
that the frequent floods of the Trent have carried
away all trace of this second borough.<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> The important
position of Nottingham was maintained in subsequent
times, and it was still a borough at Domesday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thelwall.</span>&mdash;According to Camden, Thelwall explains
by its name the kind of work which was set up
here, a wall composed of the trunks of trees. This was
another attempt to defend the course of the Mersey,
which was once tidal as far as Thelwall. No remains
of any fortifications can now be seen at Thelwall, which
was not one of the boroughs which took root. But the
Mersey has changed its course very much at this point,
even before the making of the Ship Canal effected a
more complete alteration.<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Manchester.</span>&mdash;The <i>burh</i> repaired by Edward the
Elder was no doubt the Roman castrum, which was
built on the triangle of land between the Irwell and the
Medlock. Large portions of the walls were still
remaining in Stukeley&rsquo;s time, about 1700, and some
fragments have recently been unearthed by the
Manchester Classical Association. It was one of the
smaller kind of Roman stations, its area being only
5 acres. Manchester is not mentioned as a borough
in Domesday, but the old Saxon town was long known
as Aldportton, which literally means &ldquo;the town of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
old city.&rdquo; This is its title in mediæval deeds, and it is
still preserved in <i>Alport</i> Street, a street near the
remains of the <i>castrum</i>.<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> The later borough of
Manchester, which existed at least as early as the
13th century, appears to have grown up round the
Norman castle, about a mile from the Roman castrum.<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bakewell.</span>&mdash;The vagueness of the indication in the
<i>Chronicle</i>, &ldquo;nigh to Bakewell,&rdquo; leaves us in some doubt
where we are to look for this <i>burh</i>, which Florence calls
an <i>urbs</i>. Just outside the village of Bakewell there are
the remains of a motte and bailey castle (a small motte
and bailey of 2 acres), which are always assumed to be
the <i>burh</i> of Edward. But the enclosure is far too small
for a borough, and Edward&rsquo;s burh would certainly have
enclosed the church; for though the present church
contains no Saxon architecture, the ancient cross in the
graveyard shows that it stands on a Saxon site. It is
more reasonable to suppose that Edward&rsquo;s borough, if
it was at Bakewell, has disappeared as completely as
those of Runcorn, Buckingham, and Thelwall, and that
the motte and bailey belong to one of the many
Norman castles whose names never appear in history.
There is no conclusive evidence for the existence of a
Norman castle at Bakewell, but the names Castle Field,
Warden Field, and Court Yard are at least suggestive.<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>
Bakewell was the seat of jurisdiction for the High Peak
Hundred in mediæval times.<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br />
<span class="smaller">DANISH FORTIFICATIONS</span></h2>

<p>We must now inquire into the nature of the fortifications
built by the Danes in England, which are frequently
mentioned in the <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i>. It has often
been asserted, and with great confidence, that the
Danes were the authors of the moated mounds of
class(<i>e</i>); those in Ireland are invariably spoken of by
Lewis in his <i>Topographical Dictionary</i> as &ldquo;Danish
Raths.&rdquo; This fancy seems to have gone somewhat out
of fashion since Mr Clark&rsquo;s <i>burh</i> theory occupied the
field, though Mr Clark&rsquo;s view is often so loosely
expressed as to lead one to think that he supposed all
the Northern nations to be makers of mottes; in fact,
he frequently includes the Anglo-Saxons under the
general title of &ldquo;Northmen&rdquo;!<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> We must therefore
endeavour to find out what the Danish fortifications
actually were.</p>

<p>The <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i> mentions twenty-four
places where the Danes either threw up fortifications
(between 787 and 924) or took up quarters either for
the winter, or for such a period of time that we may
infer that there was some fortification to protect them.
The word used for the fortification is generally <i>geweorc</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
a work, or <i>fæsten</i> (in two places only), which has also
the general vague meaning of a <i>fastness</i>. There are
ten places where these works or fastnesses are mentioned
in the <i>Chronicle</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Nottingham.</span>&mdash;We have already seen that the
Danish host took up their winter quarters here in 868,
and that there is the highest probability that the
borough which Edward the Elder restored was first
built by them. We have also seen that it was a camp
of roughly rectangular form, and enclosed a very large
area, necessary for great numbers.<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Rochester.</span>&mdash;This city was besieged by the
Danes in 885, and they fortified a camp outside. As
the artificial mound called Boley Hill is outside the city,
most topographers have jumped to the conclusion that
this was the Danish camp. But the character of the
Danish fortification is clearly indicated in the <i>Chronicle</i>:
&ldquo;they made a work around themselves,&rdquo; that is, it was
an enclosure.<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> They could hardly have escaped by
ship, as they did, if their camp had been above the
bridge, which is known to have existed in Saxon times.
But Boley Hill is above the bridge.</p>

<p>3.<span class="smcap"> Milton</span>, in Kent (Middeltune).&mdash;Hæsten the
Dane landed at the mouth of the Thames with 80 ships,
and wrought a <i>geweorc</i> here in 893. Two places in the
neighbourhood of Milton have been suggested as the
site of it, a square earthwork at Bayford Court, near
Sittingbourne, and a very small square enclosure called
Castle Rough. Neither of these are large enough to
have been of any use to a force which came in 80<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
ships.<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> Steenstrup has calculated that the average
number of men in a Viking ship must have been from
40 to 50; Hæsten therefore must have had at least
3200 men with him. It is therefore probable that the
camp at Milton has been swept away.</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap">Appledore.</span>&mdash;A still larger Danish force, which
had been harrying the Carlovingian empire, came in
250 ships, with their horses, in 893, and towed their
ships &ldquo;up the river&rdquo; (which is now extinct) from
Lymne to Appledore, where they wrought a work.
There are no earthworks at Appledore now, but at
Kenardington, 2 miles off, there are remains of &ldquo;a
roughly defined rectangular work, situated on the north
and east of the church, on the slope of the hill towards
the marsh, a very likely place for an entrenchment
thrown up to defend a fleet of light-draught ships
hauled up on the beach.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> The enclosure was very
large, one side which remains being 600 feet long.<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>5. <span class="smcap">Benfleet.</span>&mdash;Here Hæsten wrought a work in 894;
here he was defeated by Alfred&rsquo;s forces, and some of his
ships burnt. Mr Spurrell states that there are still
some irregular elevations by the stream and about the
church, which he believes to be remains of the Danish
camp.<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> &ldquo;As the fleet of ships lay in the Beamfleet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
it is obvious that the camp must have partaken of the
character of a fortified <i>hithe</i>, with the wall landward and
the shore open to the river and the ships.&rdquo; He also
learned on the spot that when the railway bridge across
the Fleet was being made, the remains of several ancient
ships, charred by fire, and surrounded by numerous
human skeletons, were found in the mud.<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> Benfleet
must have been a very large camp, as not only was the
joint army of Danes housed in it, that from Milton and
that from Appledore, but they had with them their
wives and children and cattle.</p>

<p>6. <span class="smcap">Shoebury</span> (<a href="#Fig_6">Fig. 6</a>).&mdash;After the storming of the
camp at Benfleet by the Saxon forces, the joint armies
of the Danes built another <i>geweorc</i> at Shoebury in
Essex. We should therefore expect a large camp here,
and Mr Spurrell has shown that the area was formerly
about a third of a square mile. About half the camp
had been washed away by the sea when Mr Spurrell
surveyed it in 1879, but enough was left to give a good
idea of the whole. It was a roughly square rampart,
with a ditch about 40 feet wide, the ditch having a kind
of berm on the inner side. The bank also had a slight
platform inside, about 3 feet above the general level.<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>
As Hæsten had lost his ships at Benfleet, there would
be no fortified hithe connected with it, and if there had
been, the sea would have swept it away. The camp
was abandoned almost as soon as it was made, and the
Danish army started on that remarkable march across
England which the <i>Saxon Chronicle</i> relates. They were
overtaken and besieged by Alfred&rsquo;s forces, in a <i>fastness</i> at</p>

<p>7. <span class="smcap">Buttington</span>, on the Severn.&mdash;It has sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
been contended that this was the Buttington near
Chepstow; but as the line of march of the army was
&ldquo;along the Thames till they reached the Severn, then
up along the Severn,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> it is more probable that it was
Buttington in Montgomery, west of Shrewsbury.<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>
Here there are remains of a strong bank with a broad
deep ditch, which was evidently part of a rectangular
earthwork, as it runs at right angles to Offa&rsquo;s Dyke,
which forms one side of it. It now encloses both the
churchyard and vicarage. Whether the Danes constructed
this earthwork, or found it there, we are not
told.</p>

<p>8. There appear to be no remains of the <i>geweorc</i> on
the river Lea, 20 miles above London, made by the
Danes in 896. But 20 miles above London, on the
Lea, would land us at Amwell, near Ware. In
Brayley&rsquo;s <i>Hertfordshire</i> it is stated that at Amwell, &ldquo;on
the hill above the church are traces of a very extensive
fortification, the rampart of which is very distinguishable
on the side overlooking the vale through which the
river Lea flows.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<div class="caption">Shoebury, Essex.</div>
</div></div>
<div class="caption">Fig. 6.</div>

<p>9. <span class="smcap">Bridgenorth</span>, or Quatbridge.&mdash;The Winchester
MS. of the <i>Chronicle</i> says the Danes wrought a <i>geweorc</i>
at Quatbridge, in 896, and passed the winter there.
There is no such place as Quatbridge now, only
Quatford; and seeing there were so few bridges in those
days, we are disposed to accept the statement of the
Worcester MS., which must have been the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
informed about events in the west, that Bridgenorth
was the site of their work, especially as the high rock
at Bridgenorth offers a natural fortification. The only
circumstance that is in favour of Quatford is that it is
mentioned as a <i>burgus</i> in Domesday, which shows that
it possessed fortifications of the civic kind; and we shall
see later on, that such fortifications were often the work
of the Danes. But this burgus may more probably have
been the work of Roger de Montgomeri, who planted
a castle there in the 11th century.</p>

<p>10. <span class="smcap">Tempsford.</span>&mdash;Here the Danes wrought a work
in 918.<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> There is a small oblong enclosure at
Tempsford, still in fair preservation, called Gannock
Castle, which is generally supposed to be this Danish
work. The ramparts are about 11 or 12 feet above the
bottom of the moat, which is about 20 feet wide.
There is a small circular mound, about 5 feet high,
on top of the rampart, which appears to be so placed
as to defend the entrance. This mound is &ldquo;edged all
round by the root of a small bank, which may have been
the base of a stockaded tower.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> This curious little
enclosure is different altogether from any of the Danish
works just enumerated, and it is difficult to see what
purpose it could have served. The area enclosed is
only half an acre, which would certainly not have
accommodated the large army &ldquo;from Huntingdon and
from the East Angles,&rdquo; which built the advanced post at
Tempsford as a base for the forcible recovery of the
districts which they had lost.<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> Such a small enclosure
as this might possibly have been a citadel, but our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
knowledge of Danish camps does not tell us of any with
citadels, and it is hardly likely that the democratic
constitution of these pirate bands would have allowed
of a citadel for the chief. It is far more probable that
this work belongs to a later time, and that the Danish
camp has been swept away by the river.<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>11. <span class="smcap">Reading.</span>&mdash;There is no &ldquo;work&rdquo; mentioned by
the <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i> at this place, which the
Danes made their headquarters in 871, but we add it
to the list because Asser not only mentions it, but
describes the nature of the fortification. It was a <i>vallum</i>
drawn between the rivers Thames and Kennet, so as to
enclose a peninsula.<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> It had several entrances, as the
Danes &ldquo;rushed out from all the gates&rdquo; on the Anglo-Saxon
attack. Such a fort belongs to the simplest and
easiest kind of defence, used at all times by a general
who is in a hurry, and it has therefore no significance
in determining the general type of Danish works.</p>

<p>Besides these eleven places where <i>works</i> are
mentioned, there are thirteen places where the Danes
are said to have taken up their winter quarters, and
where we may be certain that they were protected by
some kind of fortifications. These are Thanet, Sheppey,
Thetford, York, London, Torkesey, Repton, Cambridge,
Exeter, Chippenham, Cirencester, Fulham, and Mersey
Island. Four places out of this list&mdash;York, London,
Exeter, and Cirencester&mdash;were Roman <i>castra</i>, whose
walls were still available for defence. Three&mdash;Thanet,
Sheppey, and Mersey&mdash;were islands, and thus naturally
defended, being much more insular than they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
now.<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> Three&mdash;Thetford, Torkesey, and Cambridge&mdash;appear
as burgi in Domesday, showing that they were
fortified towns. It is highly probable that the Danes
threw up the first fortifications of these boroughs. There
are no remains of town banks at Torkesey; at Cambridge
the outline of the town bank can be traced in places;<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>
and at Thetford there was formerly an earthwork on the
Suffolk side of the river, which appears to have formed
three sides of a square, abutting on the river, and
enclosing the most ancient part of the town.<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> Chippenham
and Repton were ancient seats of the Anglo-Saxon
kings, and may have had fortifications, but nothing
remains now. Chippenham is a borough by prescription,
therefore of ancient date. At Fulham, on the
Thames, there is a quadrangular moat and bank round
the Bishop of London&rsquo;s palace, which is sometimes
supposed to be the camp made by the Danes in 879;
but it may equally well be mediæval. There was
formerly a harbour at Fulham.<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>It must be confessed that this list of Danish
fortresses furnishes us with a very slender basis for
generalisation as to the nature of Danish fortifications,
judging from the actual remains. All we can say is that
in six cases out of twenty-four (not including Tempsford
or Fulham) the work appears to have been rectangular.
In the case of Shoebury, about which we have the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
evidence, the imitation of Roman models seems to be
clear. If we turn from remaining facts to <i>à priori</i> likelihoods,
we call to mind that the Danes were a much-travelled
people, had been in Gaul as well as in England,
and had had opportunities of observing Roman fortifications,
as well as much practice both in the assault and
defence of fortified places. It may not be without
significance that it is not until after the return of &ldquo;the
army&rdquo; from France that we hear of their building
camps at all, except in the case of Reading.</p>

<p>As far as our information goes, their camps were
without citadels. What evidence we have from the
other side of the channel supports the same conclusion.
Richer gives us an account of the storming of a fortress
of the Northmen at Eu, by King Raoul, in 925, from
which it is clear that as soon as the king&rsquo;s soldiers had
got over the vallum, they were masters of the place;
there was no citadel to attack.<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> Dudo speaks of the
Vikings &ldquo;fortifying themselves, after the manner of a
<i>castrum</i>, by heaped up earth-banks drawn round themselves,&rdquo;
and it is clear from the rest of his description
that the camp had no citadel.<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>In no case do we find anything to justify the theory
that mottes were an accompaniment of Danish camps.
In five cases out of the twenty-four there are or were
mottes at the places mentioned, but in all cases they
belonged to Norman castles. The magnificent motte
called the Castle Hill at Thetford was on the opposite
side of the river to the borough, which we have seen
reason to think was the site of the Danish winter
quarters. Torkesey in Leland&rsquo;s time had by the river<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
side &ldquo;a Hille of Yerth cast up,&rdquo; which he judged to be
the donjon of some old castle, probably rightly, though
we have been unable as yet to find any mention of a
Norman castle at Torkesey; a brick castle of much
more recent date is still standing near the river, and
probably the motte to which Leland alludes was
destroyed when this was built. The motte at Cambridge
is placed inside the original bounds of the
borough, and was part of the Norman castle.<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> We
have already dealt with the Boley Hill at Rochester,
and shall have more to say about it hereafter. The
rock motte at Nottingham was probably not cut off by
a ditch from the rest of the headland until the Norman
castle was built.</p>

<p>It seems highly probable that besides providing
accommodation in their camps for very large numbers
of people, the Danes sometimes fortified the hithes
where they drew up their ships on shore, or even constructed
fortified harbours.<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> We have already quoted
Mr Spurrell&rsquo;s remark on the hithe<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> at Benfleet (<a href="#Page_51">p. 51</a>),
and there is at least one place in England which seems
to prove the existence of fortified harbours. This is
Willington, on the river Ouse, in Bedfordshire, which
has been carefully described by Mr A. R. Goddard.<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>
This &ldquo;camp&rdquo; consists of two wards, and a wide outer
enclosure (<a href="#Fig_7">Fig. 7</a>). &ldquo;But one of the most interesting
features is the presence of two harbours, contained
within the defences and communicating with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a><br /><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
river.&rdquo; Mr Goddard points out that the dimensions of the
smaller one are almost the same as those of the &ldquo;nausts&rdquo;
(ship-sheds or small docks) of the Vikings in Iceland.
He also cites from the <i>Jomsvikinga Saga</i> the description
of a harbour made by the Viking Palnatoki at Jomsborg.
&ldquo;There he had a large and strong sea <i>burg</i> made. He
also had a harbour made within the <i>burg</i> in which
300 long ships could lie at the same time, all being
locked within the burg.&rdquo; The harbours at Willington
are large enough to accommodate between twenty-five
and thirty-five ships of the Danish type. Unfortunately
there is no historical proof that the Willington works
were Danish, though their construction makes it very
likely. Nor have any works of a similar character
been as yet observed in England, as far as we are
aware.</p>

<p>But if archæology and topography give a somewhat
scanty answer to our question about the nature of
Danish fortifications, there are other fields of research,
opened up of late years, from which we can glean
important facts, bearing directly on the subject which
we are treating. Herr Steenstrup&rsquo;s exhaustive inquiry
into the Danish settlement in England has shown that
the way in which the Danes maintained their hold on
the northern and eastern shires was by planting fortified
towns on which the soldiers and peasants dwelling
around were dependent.<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> The <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i>
gives us a glimpse of these arrangements when it
speaks of the Danes who owed obedience to Bedford,
Derby, Leicester, Northampton, and Cambridge.<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> It
also tells us of the Five Boroughs, which, as we
have already said, appear to have been a confederation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
of boroughs forming an independent Danish state
between the Danish kingdoms of East Anglia and
Northumbria.</p>

<p>The same system was followed by the Danes who
colonised Ireland. &ldquo;The colony had a centre in a
fortified town, or it consisted almost exclusively of
dwellers in one. But round this town was a district,
in which the Irish inhabitants had to pay taxes to the
lords of the town.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> The Irish chronicle called <i>The
Wars of the Gaedhil and the Gaill</i> says, further, that
Norse soldiers were quartered in the country round
these towns in the houses of the native Irish, and it
even says that there was hardly a house without a
Norseman.<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> Herr Steenstrup does not go so far as
to assert that this system of quartering obtained in
England also; but he shows that it is probable, and
we may add that such a system would help to explain
the speedy absorption of the Danes into the Anglo-Saxon
population, which took place in the Danelaw
districts.<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>The large numbers of the Danish forces, and the
fact that in the second period of their invasions they
brought their wives and children with them, would
render camps of large area necessary. These numbers
alone make it ridiculous to attribute to the Danes the
small motte castles of class (<i>e</i>), whose average area is
not more than 3 acres.</p>

<p>Finally, the Danish host was not a feudal host.
Steenstrup asserts that the principle of the composition
of the host was the voluntary association of equally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
powerful leaders, of whom one was chosen as head, and
was implicitedly obeyed, but had only a temporary
authority.<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> We should not, therefore, expect to find
the Danish camps provided with the citadels by which
the feudal baron defended his personal safety. When
Rollo and his host were coming up the Seine, the
Frankish king Raoul sent messengers to ask them who
they were, and what was the name of their chief.
&ldquo;Danes,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;and we have no chief, for we
are all equal.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> That such an answer would be given
by men who were following a leader so distinguished
as Rollo shows the spirit of independence which pervaded
the Danish hosts, and how little a separate fortification
for the chief would comport with their methods
of warfare.<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>We may conclude, then, with every appearance of
certainty that the Danish camps were enclosures of
large area which very much resembled the larger Roman
<i>castra</i>, and that, like these, they frequently grew into
towns. Placed as they generally were on good havens,
or on navigable rivers, they were most suitable places
for trade; and it turned out that the Danes, who were
a people of great natural aptitudes, had a special
aptitude for commerce.<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> Dr Cunningham remarks
that they were the leading merchants of the country, and
he attributes to them a large share in the development
of town life in England.<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> The organisation of their
armies was purely military, but at the same time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
democratic; and when it was applied to a settled life in
the new country, the organisation of the town was the
form which it took. The Lagmen of Lincoln, Stamford,
Cambridge, Chester, and York are a peculiarly Scandinavian
institution, which we find still existing at the
time of the Domesday Survey.<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>Thus we see that the fortifications of the Danes,
like those of the Anglo-Saxons, were the fortifications
of the community. And we shall see in the next
chapter that this was the general type of the fortifications
which were being raised in Western Europe in
the 9th century.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br />
<span class="smaller">THE ORIGIN OF PRIVATE CASTLES</span></h2>

<p>We have now seen that history furnishes no instance of
the existence of private castles among the Anglo-Saxons
or the Danes (previous to the arrival of Edward the
Confessor&rsquo;s Norman friends), and we have endeavoured
to show that this negative evidence is of great significance.
If, assuming that we are right in accepting it
as conclusive, we ask why the Anglo-Saxons did not
build private castles, the answer is ready to hand in the
researches of the late Dr Stubbs, the late Professor
Maitland, Dr J. H. Round, and Professor Vinogradoff,
which have thrown so much fresh light on the constitutional
history of England. These writers have made
it clear that whatever tendencies towards feudalism
there were in England before the Conquest, the system
of military tenure, which is the backbone of feudalism,
was introduced into England by William the Conqueror.<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>
&ldquo;Feudalism, in both tenure and government was, so far
as it existed in England, brought full-grown from
France,&rdquo; says Dr Stubbs; and this statement is not
merely supported, but strengthened, by the work of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
later writers named.<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> The institutions of the Anglo-Saxons,
when they settled in England, were tribal; and
though these institutions were in a state of decay in the
11th century, they were not completely superseded by
feudal institutions till after the Norman Conquest.</p>

<p>We should naturally expect, then, that the fortifications
erected by the Anglo-Saxons would be those
adapted to their originally tribal state, that is, in
the words which we have so often used already, they
would be those of the community and not of the
individual. And as far as we can discover the character
of these fortifications, we find that this was actually the
case. As we have seen, we find one of the earliest
kings, Ida, building for the defence of himself and his
followers what Bede calls a city; and we find Alfred and
his children also building and repairing cities, at the
time of the Danish invasions.</p>

<p>The same kind of thing was going on at about the
same time in Germany and in France. Henry the
Fowler (919-936), that great restorer of the Austrasian
kingdom, planted on the frontiers which were exposed
to the attacks of the Danes and Huns a number of
walled strongholds, not only for the purpose of resisting
invasion, but to afford a place of refuge to all the
inhabitants of the country. He ordained that every
ninth man of the peasants in the district must build<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
for himself and his nine companions a dwelling in the
&ldquo;Burg,&rdquo; and provide barns and storehouses, and that the
third part of all crops must be delivered and housed in
these towns.<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> In this way, says the historian Giesebrecht,
he sought to accustom the Saxons, who had hitherto
dwelt in isolated farms, or open villages, to life in towns.
He ordered that all assemblies of the people should be
held in towns. Giesebrecht also remarks that it is not
improbable that Henry the Fowler had the example of
Edward the Elder of England before his eyes when he
established these rows of frontier towns.<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p>The same causes led, on Neustrian soil, to the
fortification of a number of cities, the walls of which had
fallen into decay during the period of peace before the
invasions of the Danes. Thus Charles the Bald commanded
Le Mans and Tours to be fortified &ldquo;as a defence
<i>for the people</i> against the Northmen.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> The bishops
were particularly active in thus defending the people of
their dioceses. Archbishop Fulk rebuilt the walls of
Rheims, between 884 and 900;<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> his successor, Hervey,
fortified the town of Coucy<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> (about 900); the Bishop of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
Cambray built new walls to his city in 887-911;<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> and
Bishop Erluin fortified Peronne in 1001, &ldquo;as a defence
against marauders, and a refuge for the husbandmen of
the country.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> But permission had probably to be asked
in all these cases, as it certainly had in the last. The
Carlovingian sovereigns represented a well-ordered state,
modelled on the pattern of the Roman Empire; they
were jealous of any attempts at self-defence which did
not proceed from the State, and thus as long as they had
the power they strove to put down all associations or
buildings of a military character which did not emanate
from their imperial authority.</p>

<p>The history of the 9th and 10th centuries is the
history of the gradual break-up of the Carlovingian
Empire, and the rise of feudalism on its ruins. In 877,
the year of his death, Charles the Bald signed a decree
making the counts of the provinces, who until then had
been imperial officers, hereditary. He thus, as Sismondi
says, annihilated the remains of royal authority in the
provinces.<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> The removable officers now became local
sovereigns. Gradually, as the Carlovingian Empire fell
to pieces, the artificial organisation of the feudal system
arose to take its place. By the end of the 10th century
the victory of feudalism was complete; and the victory
of feudalism was the victory of the private castle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The very word castle,&rdquo; says Guizot, &ldquo;brings with
it the idea of feudal society; we see it rising before us.
It was feudalism that built these castles which once
covered our soil, and whose ruins are still scattered upon
it. They were the declaration of its triumph. Nothing
like them had existed on Gallo-Roman soil. Before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
Germanic invasion, the great landed proprietors dwelt
either in the cities, or in beautiful houses agreeably
situated near the cities.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> These Gallo-Roman villas had
no fortifications;<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> nor were the Roman villas in England
fortified.<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> It was the business of the State to defend the
community; this was the theory so long sustained by
imperial Rome, and which broke down so completely
under the later Carlovingians.</p>

<p>In the time of Charlemagne and Louis le Debonnaire,
even the royal palaces do not appear to have been
fortified. They were always spoken of as <i>palatia</i>, never
as <i>castella</i>. The Danes, when they took possession of
the palace of Nimeguen in 880, fortified it with ditches
and banks.<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> Charles the Bald appears to have been the
first to fortify the palace of Compiègne.<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p>Although there can be no doubt that private castles
had become extremely common on the mainland of
Western Europe before the end of the 10th century, it is
more difficult than is generally supposed to trace their
first appearance. Historians, even those of great repute,
have been somewhat careless in translating the words
<i>castrum</i> or <i>castellum</i> as <i>castle</i> or <i>château</i>, and taking
them in the sense of the feudal or private castle.<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
have already pointed out that these words in our Anglo-Saxon
charters mean a town or village.<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> The fact is
that from Roman times until toward the end of the 9th
century the words <i>castrum</i> and <i>castellum</i> are used indifferently
for a fortified city or town, or a temporary
camp. The expression <i>civitates et castella</i> is not
uncommon, and might lead one to think that a distinction
was drawn between large and small towns, or forts.
But it is far more likely that it is a mere pleonasm, a
bit of that redundancy which was always dear to the
mediæval scribe who was trying to write well. For as
the instances cited in the <a href="#APPENDIX_D">Appendix</a> will prove, we
constantly find the words <i>castrum</i> and <i>castellum</i> used for
the same town, sometimes even in the same paragraph.
Later, from the last quarter of the 9th century to the
middle of the 12th century, these same words are used
indifferently for a town or a castle, and it is impossible
to tell, except by the context, whether a town or a castle
is meant; and often even the context throws no light
upon it.</p>

<p>This makes it extremely difficult to say with any
exactness when the private castle first arose. We seem
indeed to have a fixed date in the Capitulary of Pistes,
issued by Charles the Bald in 864,<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> in which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
straightly ordered that all who had made castles, forts,
or hedge-works without his permission should forthwith
be compelled to destroy them, because through them the
whole neighbourhood suffered depredation and annoyance.
This edict shows, we might argue, that private
castles were sufficiently numerous by the year 864 to
have become a public nuisance, calling for special
legislation. But the chronicles of the second half of the
9th century do not reveal any extensive prevalence of
private castles. Indeed, after studying all the most
important chronicles of Neustria and Austrasia during
this period, the present writer has only been able to find
four instances of fortifications which have any claim at
all to be considered private castles; and even this claim
is doubtful.<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>When we come to the chroniclers of the middle of
the 10th century we find a marked difference. It is true
that the words <i>castrum</i>, <i>castellum</i>, <i>municipium</i>, <i>oppidum</i>,
<i>munitio</i>, are still used quite indifferently by
Flodoard and other writers for one and the same thing,
and that in a great many cases they obviously mean a
fortified town. But there are other cases where they
evidently mean a castle. And if we compare these
writers with the earlier ones in the same way as we have
already compared the pre-Conquest portion of the <i>Anglo-Saxon
Chronicle</i> with the chroniclers of the 11th and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
12th centuries, we find the same contrast between them.
In the pages of Flodoard or Ademar the action
constantly turns on the building, besieging, and burning
of castles, which by whatever name they are called, have
every appearance of being private castles. In fact
before we get to the end of the century, the private
castle is as much the leading feature of the drama as it
is in the 11th or 12th centuries.</p>

<p>Why, then, had the chroniclers no fresh word for a
thing which was in its essential nature so novel? The
obvious and only answer is that the private castle in its
earlier stages was nothing more than an embankment
with a wooden stockade thrown round some <i>villa</i> or
farm belonging to a private owner, and was therefore
indistinguishable in appearance, though radically different
in idea, from the fortifications which had hitherto
been thrown up for the protection of the community.<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>
How easily we may be mistaken in the meaning of the
word <i>castellum</i>, if we interpret it according to modern
ideas, may be seen by comparing the account of the
bridge built by Charlemagne over the Elbe, in the
<i>Annales Laurissenses</i>, with Eginhards narrative of the
same affair. The former states that Charlemagne built
a <i>castellum</i> of wood and earth at each end of the bridge,
while the latter tells us that it was a <i>vallum</i> to protect a
garrison which he placed there. This, however, was a
work of public utility, and not a private castle. But
scanty as the evidence is, it all leads us to infer that
the first private castles were fortifications of this simple
nature.<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> Mazières-on-the-Meuse, which was besieged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
for four weeks by Archbishop Hervey, took its name
from the <i>macerias</i> or banks which Count Erlebald had
constructed around it. It is impossible to say whether
this enclosure should be called a castle or a town, but in
idea it was certainly a castle, since it was an enclosure
formed for private, not for public interests.</p>

<p>Whether these first private castles were provided
with towers we have no evidence either to prove or to
disprove. No instance occurs from which we can
conclude that they possessed any kind of citadel, before
the middle of the 10th century.<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> But before the century
is far advanced, we hear of towers in connection with
the great towns, which, whether they were originally
mural towers or not, are evidently private strongholds,
and may justly be called keeps. The earliest instance
known to the writer is in 924, when the tower of the
<i>presidium</i> where Herbert Count of Vermandois had
imprisoned Charles the Simple was burnt accidentally.<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>
This tower must have been restored, as nine years later
it withstood a six weeks&rsquo; siege from King Raoul. A
possibly earlier instance is that of Nantes, where Bishop
Fulcher had made a castle in 889; for when this castle
was restored by Count Alan Barbetorte (937-943), we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
told that he <i>restored</i> the principal tower and made it
into his own house.<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> Count Herbert built a keep in
Laon before 931; and this appears to have been a
different tower to the one attached to the royal house
which Louis d&rsquo;Outremer had built at the gate of the
city.<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> We hear also of towers at Amiens (950), Coucy
(958), Chalons (963), and Rheims (988). All these
towers, it will be observed, are connected with towns.<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>
The first stone keep in the country for whose date we
have positive evidence, is that of Langeais, built by Fulk
Nerra, Count of Anjou, about the year 994; its ruins still
exist.</p>

<p>But we are concerned more particularly here with the
origin of the motte-and-bailey castle. The exact place
or time of its first appearance is still a matter of
conjecture. Certainly there is not a word in the
chronicles which is descriptive of this kind of castle
before the beginning of the 11th century.<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> The first
historical mention of a castle which is clearly of the
motte-and-bailey kind is in the Chronicle of St Florent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
le Vieil, where, at a date which the modern biographer of
Fulk Nerra fixes at 1010, we learn that this same Count
of Anjou built a castle on the western side of the hill
Mont-Glonne, at St Florent le Vieil, on the Loire, and
threw up an <i>agger</i> on which he built a wooden tower.<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>
In this case the word <i>agger</i> evidently means a motte.
But Fulk began to reign in 987; he was a great builder
of castles, and was famed for his skill in military affairs.<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>
One of his first castles, built between 991 and 994, was
at Montbazon, not far from Tours. About 500
metres from the later castle of Montbazon is a motte
and outworks, which De Salies not unreasonably
supposes to be the original castle of Fulk.<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> Montrichard,
Chateaufort, Chérament, Montboyau, and
Baugé are all castles built by Fulk, and all have or had
mottes. Montboyau is the clearest case of all, as it was
demolished by Fulk a few years after he built it, and has
never been restored, so that the immense motte and outworks
which are still to be seen remain very much in
their original state, except that a modern tower has been
placed on the motte, which is now called Bellevue.<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a tempting theory at one time to the writer
to see in Fulk Nerra the inventor of the motte type of
castle, for independently of his fame in military architecture,
he is the first mediæval chieftain who is known
to have employed mercenary troops.<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> Now as we have
already suggested in <a href="#CHAPTER_I">Chapter I</a>., the plan of the motte-and-bailey
castle strongly suggests that there may be
a connection between its adoption and the use of
mercenaries. For the plan of this kind of castle seems
to hint that the owner does not only mistrust his
enemies, he also does not completely trust his garrison.
The keep in which he and his family live is placed on
the top of the motte, which is ditched round so as to
separate it from the bailey; the provisions on which all
are dependent are stored in the cellar of the keep, so
that they are under his own hand; and the keys of the
outer ward are brought to him every night, and placed
under his pillow.<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p>But unfortunately for this theory, there is some
evidence of the raising of mottes at an earlier period in
the 10th century than the accession of Fulk Nerra.
Thibault-le-Tricheur, who was Count of Blois and
Chartres from 932 to 962, was also a great builder, and
it is recorded of him that he built the keeps of Chartres,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
Chateaudun,<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> Blois, and Chinon,<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> and the castle of
Saumur; these must have been finished before 962.
Now there was anciently a motte at Blois, for in the
12th century, Fulk V. of Anjou burnt the whole fortress,
&ldquo;<i>except the house on the motte</i>.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> There was also a
motte at Saumur;<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> and the plan of the castle of Chinon
is not inconsistent with the existence of a former motte.<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>
These instances seem to put back the existence of the
motte castle to the middle of the 10th century.</p>

<p>We know of no earlier claim than this, unless we
were to accept the statement of Lambert of Ardres that
Sigfrid the Dane, who occupied the county of Guisnes
about the year 928, fortified the town, and enclosed his
own <i>dunio</i> with a double ditch.<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> If this were true, we
have a clear instance of a motte built in the first half of
the 10th century. But Lambert&rsquo;s work was written at
the end of the 12th century, with the object of glorifying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
the counts of Guisnes, and its editor regards the early
part of it as fabulous. That Sigfrid fortified the <i>town</i>
of Guisnes we can easily believe, as we know the Danes
commonly did the like (see <a href="#CHAPTER_IV">Chapter IV</a>.); but that he
built himself a personal castle is unlikely.<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<p>It is the more unlikely, because the Danes in
Normandy do not appear to have built personal castles
until the feudal system was introduced there by Richard
Sans Peur. The settlement in Normandy was not on
feudal lines. &ldquo;Rollo divided out the lands among his
powerful comrades, and there is scarcely any doubt that
they received these lands as inheritable property, without
any other pledge than to help Rollo in the defence of
the country.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> &ldquo;The Norman constitution at Rollo&rsquo;s
death can be described thus, that the duke ruled the
country as an independent prince in relation to the
Franks; but for its internal government he had a council
at his side, whose individual members felt themselves
almost as powerful as the duke himself.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> Sir Francis
Palgrave asserts that feudalism was introduced into
Normandy by the Duke Richard Sans Peur, the
grandson of Rollo, towards the middle of the 10th
century. He &ldquo;enforced a most extensive conversion
of allodial lands into feudal tenure,&rdquo; and exacted from
his baronage the same feudal submission which he
himself had rendered to Hugh Capet.<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

<p>It is quite in accordance with this that in the
narrative of Dudo, who is our only authority for the
history of Normandy in the 10th century, there is no
mention of a private castle anywhere. We are told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
that Rollo restored the walls and towers of the <i>cities</i> of
Normandy,<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> and it is clear from the context that the
<i>castra</i> of Rouen, Fécamp, and Evreux, which are mentioned,
are fortified cities, not castles. Even the ducal
residence at Rouen is spoken of as a <i>palatium</i> or an
<i>aula</i>, not as a castle; and it does not appear to have
possessed a keep until (as we are told by a later writer)
the same Duke Richard who introduced the feudal
system into Normandy built one for his own residence.<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>
It is possible that when the feudal oath was exacted
from the more important barons, permission was given
to them to build castles for themselves; thus we hear
from Ordericus of the castle of Aquila, built in the days
of Duke Richard; the castle of the lords of Grantmesnil
at Norrei; the castle of Belesme; all of which appear
to have been private castles.<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> But there seems to have
been no general building of castles until the time of
William the Conqueror&rsquo;s minority, when his rebellious
subjects raised castles against him on all sides. &ldquo;Plura
per loca aggeres erexerunt, et tutissimas sibi munitiones
construxerunt.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> It is generally, and doubtless correctly,
supposed that <i>aggeres</i> in this passage means
mottes, and taking this statement along with the great
number of mottes which are still to be found in
Normandy, it has been further assumed (and the present
writer was disposed to share the idea) that this was the
time of the first invention of mottes. But the facts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
which have been now adduced, tracing back the first
known mottes to the time of Thibault-le-Tricheur, and
the county of Blois, show that the Norman claim to the
invention of this mode of fortification must be given up.
If the Normans were late in adopting feudalism, they
were probably equally late in adopting private castles,
and the fortifications of William I.&rsquo;s time were most
likely copied from castles outside the Norman frontier.<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<p>It might be thought that the general expectation of
the end of the world in the year 1000, which prevailed
towards the end of the 10th century, had something to
do with the spread of these wooden castles, as it might
have seemed scarcely worth while to build costly
structures of stone. But it is not necessary to resort
to this hypothesis, because there is quite sufficient
evidence to show that long before this forecast of doom
was accepted, wood was a very common, if not the
commonest, material used in fortification. The reader
has only to open his Cæsar to see how familiar wooden
towers and wooden palisades were to the Romans; and
he has only to study carefully the chronicles of the
9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th centuries to see how all-prevalent
this mode of fortification continued to be.
The general adoption of the feudal system must have
brought about a demand for cheap castles, which was
excellently met by the motte with its wooden keep and
its stockaded bailey. M. Enlart has pointed out that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
wooden defences have one important advantage over
stone ones, their greater cohesion, which enabled them
to resist the blows of the battering-ram better than
rubble masonry.<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> Their great disadvantage was their
liability to fire; but this was obviated, as in the time of
the Romans, by spreading wet hides over the outsides.
Stone castles were still built, where money and means
were available, as we see from Fulk Nerra&rsquo;s keep at
Langeais; but the devastations of the Northmen had
decimated the population of Gaul; labour must have
been dear, and skilled masons hard to find. In these
social and economic reasons we have sufficient cause for
the rapid spread of wooden castles in France.</p>

<p>The sum of the evidence which we have been
reviewing is this: the earliest mottes which we know of
were <i>probably</i> built by Thibault-le-Tricheur about the
middle of the 10th century. But in the present state of
our knowledge we must leave the question of the time
and place of their first origin open. The only thing
about which we can be certain is that they were the
product of feudalism, and cannot have arisen till it had
taken root; that is to say, not earlier than the 10th
century.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />
<span class="smaller">DISTRIBUTION AND CHARACTERISTICS OF MOTTE-CASTLES</span></h2>

<p>The motte-and-bailey type of castle is to be found
throughout feudal Europe, but is probably more
prevalent in France and the British Isles than anywhere
else. We say <i>probably</i>, because there are as yet
no statistics prepared on which to base a comparison.<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>
How recent the inquiry into this subject is may be
learned from the fact that Krieg von Hochfelden,
writing in 1859, denied the existence of mottes in
Germany;<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> and even Cohausen in 1898 threw doubt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
upon them,<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> although General Köhler in 1887 had
already declared that &ldquo;the researches of recent years
have shown that the motte was spread over the whole
of Germany, and was in use even in the 13th and 14th
centuries.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> The greater number of the castles
described by Piper in his work on Austrian castles are
on the motte-and-bailey plan, though the motte in
those mountainous provinces is generally of natural
rock, isolated either by nature or art. Mottes were not
uncommon in Italy, according to Muratori,<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> and are
especially frequent in Calabria, where we may strongly
suspect that they were introduced by the Norman
conqueror, Robert Guiscard.<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> It is not improbable that
the Franks of the first crusade planted in Palestine the
type of castle to which they were accustomed at home,
for several of the excellent plans in Rey&rsquo;s <i>Architecture
des Croisés</i> show clearly enough the motte-and-bailey
plan.<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> In most of these cases the motte was a natural
rock.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we are told by Köhler that
motte-castles are not found among the Slavonic nations,
because they never adopted the feudal system.<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> Nor
are there any in Norway or Sweden.<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> Denmark has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
some, which are attributed by Dr Sophus Müller to the
mediæval period.<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p>Of course whenever a motte was thrown up, the first
castle upon it must have been a wooden one. A stone
keep could not be placed on loose soil.<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> The motte,
therefore, must always represent the oldest castle. But
there is no reason to think that the motte and its
wooden keep were merely temporary expedients, intended
always to be replaced as soon as possible by stone
buildings. Even after stone castles had been fully
developed, wood continued to hold its ground as a solid
building material until a very late period.<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> And mottes
were used not only throughout the 11th and 12th
centuries, but even as late as the 13th. King John
built many castles of this type in Ireland; and as late
as 1242 Henry III. ordered a motte and wooden castle
to be built in the island of Rhé.<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> Muratori gives a
much later instance: in 1320 Can Grande caused a
great motte to be built near Pavia, and surrounded with
a ditch and hedge, in order to build a castle on it.<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
And as will be seen in the next chapter, there is
considerable evidence that many mottes in England
which were set up in the reign of William I., retained
their wooden towers or stockades even till as late as the
reign of Edward I. The motte at Drogheda held out
some time against Cromwell, and is spoken of by him
as a very strong place, having a good graft (ditch) and
strongly palisaded.<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> Tickhill Castle in Yorkshire had a
palisade on the counterscarp of the ditch when it was
taken by Cromwell.<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>

<p>The position of these motte-castles is wholly
different from that of prehistoric fortresses. They are
almost invariably placed in the arable country, and as
a rule not in isolated situations, but in the immediate
neighbourhood of towns or villages. It is rare indeed
to find a motte-castle in a wild, mountainous situation
in England. The only instance which occurs to the
writer is that of the motte on the top of the Hereford
Beacon; but there is great probability that this was a
post fortified by the Bishop of Hereford in the 13th
century to protect his game from the Earl of Gloucester.
Nothing pointing to a prehistoric origin was found in
this motte when it was excavated by Mr Hilton Price,<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>
though the camp in which it is placed is supposed to
be prehistoric.</p>

<p>The great majority of mottes in England are planted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
either on or near Roman or other ancient roads, or on
navigable rivers.<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> It was essential to the Norman
settlers that they should be near some road which would
help them to visit their other estates, which William had
been so careful to scatter, and would also enable them to
revisit from time to time their estates in Normandy.<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a>
The rivers of England were much fuller of water in
mediæval times than they are now, and were much more
extensively used for traffic; they were real waterways.
When we find a motte perched on a river which is not
navigable, the purpose probably was to defend some
ford, or to exact tolls from passengers. Thus the Ferry
Hill (corrupted into Fairy Hill) at Whitwood stands at
the spot where the direct road from Pontefract to Leeds
would cross the Calder. It was probably not usual for
the motte to be dependent on a stream or a spring for
its supply of water, and this is another point in which
the mediæval castle differs markedly from the prehistoric
camp; wells have been found in a number of mottes
which have been excavated, and it is probable that this
was the general plan, though we have not sufficient
statistics on this subject as yet.<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></p>

<p>Occasionally, but very rarely, we find two mottes in
the same castle. The only instances in England known
to the writer are at Lewes and Lincoln.<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> It is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
unfrequent to find a motte very near a stone castle. In
this case it is either the abandoned site of the original
wooden castle, or it is a siege castle raised to blockade
the other one. We constantly hear of these siege
castles being built in the Middle Ages; their purpose
was not for actual attack, but to watch the besieged fort
and prevent supplies from being carried in.<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> Hillocks
were also thrown up for the purpose of placing <i>balistæ</i>
and other siege engines upon them; but these would be
much smaller than mottes, and would be placed much
nearer the walls than blockade castles.</p>

<p>The mottes of France are in all probability much
more decidedly military than those of England.
France was a land of private war, after the dissolution
of the empire of Charlemagne; and no doubt one of the
reasons for the rapid spread of the motte-castle, after its
invention, was due to the facilities which it offered for
this terrible game. In England the reasons for the
erection of mottes seem to have been manorial rather
than military; that is, the Norman landholder desired a
safe residence for himself amidst a hostile peasantry,
rather than a strong military position which could hold
out against skilful and well-armed foes.</p>

<p>Attached to the castle, both in England and abroad,
we frequently find an additional enclosure, much larger
than the comparatively small area of the bailey proper.
This was the <i>burgus</i> or borough, which inevitably
sprang up round every castle which had a lengthened
existence. Our older antiquaries, finding that the word
<i>burgenses</i> was commonly used in Domesday in connection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
with a site where a castle existed, formed the mistaken
idea that a <i>burgus</i> necessarily implied a castle. But a
<i>burgus</i> was the same thing as a <i>burh</i>, that is, a <i>borough</i>
or fortified town. It may have existed long before the
castle, or it may have been created after the castle was
built. The latter case was very common, for the noble
who built a castle would find it to his advantage to
build a <i>burgus</i> near it.<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> In exchange for the protection
offered by the borough wall or bank, he could demand
<i>gablum</i> or rent from the burghers; he could compel
them to grind their corn at his mill, and bake their
bread at his oven; he could exact tolls on all commodities
entering the borough; and if there was a
market he would receive a certain percentage on all
sales. The borough was therefore an important source
of revenue to the baron. Domesday Book mentions the
<i>new borough</i> at Rhuddlan, evidently built as soon as the
castle had been planted on the deserted banks of the
Clwydd. In some cases a &ldquo;new borough&rdquo; is clearly a
new suburb, doubtless having its own fortifications,
built specially for the protection of the Norman settlers
in England, as at Norwich and Nottingham.<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

<p>That even in the 12th century a motte was considered
an essential feature of a castle is shown by Neckham&rsquo;s
treatise &ldquo;De Utensilibus,&rdquo; where he gives directions as to
how a castle should be built; the motte should be
placed on a site well defended by nature; it should have
a stockade of squared logs round the top; the keep
on the motte should be furnished with turrets and
battlements, and crates of stones for missiles should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
always provided, as well as a perpetual spring of water,
and secret passages and posterns, by which help might
reach the besieged.<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<p>What the outward appearance of these motte-castles
was we learn from the Bayeux Tapestry, which gives us
several instructive pictures of motte-castles existing in
the 11th century at Dol, Rennes, Dinan, and Bayeux.<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>
There is considerable variety in these pictures, and
something no doubt must be ascribed to fancy; but all
show the main features of a stockade round the top of
the motte, enclosing a wooden tower, a ditch round the
foot of the motte, with a bank on the counterscarp,
and a stepped wooden bridge, up which horses were
evidently trained to climb, leading across the moat to
the stockade of the motte. In no case is the bailey
distinctly depicted, but we may assume that it has been
already taken, and that the horsemen are riding over it
to the gate-house which (in the picture of Dinan) stands
at the foot of the bridge. The towers appear to be
square, but in the case of Rennes and Bayeux, are
surmounted by a cupola roof. Decoration does not
appear to be have been neglected, and the general
appearance of the buildings, far from being of a makeshift
character, must have been very picturesque.</p>

<p>The picture of the building of the motte at Hastings
shows only a stockade on top of the motte; this may be
because the artist intended to represent the work as
incomplete. What is remarkable about this picture is
that the motte appears to be formed in layers of
different materials. We might ascribe this to the fancy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
of the embroiderer, were it not that layers of this kind
have occasionally been found in mottes which have been
excavated or destroyed. Thus the motte at Carisbrook,
which was opened in 1903, was found to be composed of
alternate layers of large and small chalk rubble. In
some cases, layers of stones have been found; in others
(as at York and Burton) a motte formed of loose
material has been cased in a sort of pie-crust of heavy
clay. In the Castle Hill at Hallaton in Leicestershire
layers of peat and hazel branches, as well as of clay
and stone boulders, were found. But our information on
this subject is too scanty to justify any generalisations
as to the general construction of mottes.</p>

<p>The pictures shown in the Bayeux Tapestry agree
very well with the description given by a 12th-century
writer of the castle of Merchem, near Dixmüde, in the
life of John, Bishop of Terouenne, who died in 1130.
&ldquo;Bishop John used to stay frequently at Merchem when
he was going round his diocese. Near the churchyard
was an exceedingly high fortification, which might be
called a castle or <i>municipium</i>, built according to the
fashion of that country by the lord of the manor many
years before. For it is the custom of the nobles of that
region, who spend their time for the most part in private
war, in order to defend themselves from their enemies
to make a hill of earth, as high as they can, and encircle
it with a ditch as broad and deep as possible. They
surround the upper edge of this hill with a very strong
wall of hewn logs, placing towers on the circuit, according
to their means. Inside this wall they plant their
house, or keep (arcem), which overlooks the whole thing.
The entrance to this fortress is only by a bridge, which
rises from the counterscarp of the ditch, supported on
double or even triple columns, till it reaches the upper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
edge of the motte (agger).&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> The chronicler goes on to
relate how this wooden bridge broke down under the
crowd of people who were following the bishop, and all
fell 35 feet into the ditch, where the water was up to
their knees. There is no mention of a bailey in this
account, but a bailey was so absolutely necessary to
a residential castle, in order to find room for the
stables, lodgings, barns, smithies and other workshops,
which were necessary dependencies of a feudal
household, that it can seldom have been omitted,
and the comparatively rare instances which we find
of mottes which appear never to have had baileys
were probably outposts dependent on some more important
castle.</p>

<p>Lambert of Ardres, the panegyrist of the counts of
Guisnes,<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> writing about 1194, gives us a minute and
most interesting description of the wooden castle of
Ardres, built about the year 1117. &ldquo;Arnold, lord of
Ardres, built on the motte of Ardres a wooden house,
excelling all the houses of Flanders of that period both
in material and in carpenter&rsquo;s work. The first storey
was on the surface of the ground, where were cellars
and granaries, and great boxes, tuns, casks, and other
domestic utensils. In the storey above were the dwelling
and common living rooms of the residents, in which were
the larders, the rooms of the bakers and butlers, and the
great chamber in which the lord and his wife slept.
Adjoining this was a private room, the dormitory of the
waiting maids and children. In the inner part of the
great chamber was a certain private room, where at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
early dawn or in the evening or during sickness or at
time of blood-letting, or for warming the maids and
weaned children, they used to have a fire.... In the
upper storey of the house were garret rooms, in which
on the one side the sons (when they wished it) on the
other side the daughters (because they were obliged) of
the lord of the house used to sleep. In this storey also
the watchmen and the servants appointed to keep the
house took their sleep at some time or other. High up
on the east side of the house, in a convenient place, was
the chapel, which was made like unto the tabernacle of
Solomon in its ceiling and painting. There were stairs
and passages from storey to storey, from the house into
the kitchen, from room to room, and again from the
house into the <i>loggia</i> (logium), where they used to sit in
conversation for recreation, and again from the loggia
into the oratory.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>

<p>This description proves that these wooden castles
were no mere rude sheds for temporary occupation, but
that they were carefully built dwellings designed for
permanent residence. The description is useful for the
light it throws on the stone keeps whose ruins remain to
us. They probably had very similar arrangements, and
though only their outside walls are now existing, they
must have been divided into different rooms by wooden
partitions which have now perished.<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>

<p>In this account of Lambert&rsquo;s it is further mentioned
that the kitchen was joined to the house or keep, and
was a building of two floors, the lower one being
occupied by live stock, while the upper one was the
actual kitchen. We must remember that this account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
was written at the end of the 12th century. In the
earlier and simpler manners of the 11th century it is
probable that the cooking was more generally carried on
in the open air, as it was among the Anglo-Saxons.<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a>
The danger of fire would prevent the development of
chimneys in wooden castles; we have seen that there
was only one in this wonderful castle of Ardres. But
even after stone castles became common, we have evidence
that the kitchen was often an isolated building in the
courtyard. One such kitchen still exists in the monastic
ruins of Glastonbury.</p>

<p>The word <i>mota</i>, which was used in the 12th century
for the artificial hills on which the wooden keeps of these
castles were placed, comes from an old French word
<i>motte</i>, meaning a clod of earth, which is still used in
France for a small earthen hillock.<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> The keep itself
appears to have been called a <i>bretasche</i>, though this word
seems to have meant a wooden tower of any kind, and
was used both for mural towers and for the movable
wooden towers employed for sieges.<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> At a much later
period it was given to the wooden balconies by which
walls were defended, but the writer has found no instance
of this use of the word before the 14th century. On the
contrary, these wooden galleries for the purpose of
defending the foot of the walls by throwing missiles
down are called <i>hurdicia</i> or hourdes in the documents, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
word of cognate origin to our word <i>hoarding</i>.<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> The
word <i>bretasche</i> is also of Teutonic origin, akin to the
German <i>brett</i>, a board.</p>

<p>The court at the base of the hillock is always called
the <i>ballium</i>, <i>bayle</i>, or <i>bailey</i>, a word for which Skeat
suggests the Latin <i>baculus</i>, a stick, as a possible though
very doubtful ancestor. The wooden wall which surrounded
this court was the <i>palum</i>, <i>pelum</i>, or <i>palitium</i> of
the documents, a word which Mr Neilson has proved to
be the origin of the <i>peels</i> so common in Lowland Scotland,
though it has been mistakenly applied to the towers
enclosed by these peels.<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> The <i>palitium</i> was the stockade
on the inner bank of the ditch which enclosed the
bailey; but the outer or counterscarp bank had also its
special defence, called the <i>hericio</i>, from its bristling nature
(French <i>hérisson</i>, a hedgehog). There can be little
doubt that it was sometimes an actual hedge of brambles,
at other times of stakes intertwined with osiers or
thorns.<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>

<p>Thus the words most commonly used in connection
with these wooden castles are chiefly French in form,
but a French that is tinctured with Teutonic blood.
This is just what we might expect, since the first castles
of feudalism arose on Gallic soil (France or Flanders),
but on soil which was ruled by men of Teutonic descent.
We may regard it as fairly certain that it was in the
region anciently known as Neustria that the motte-castle
first appeared; and as we have previously shown, there
is some reason to think that the centre of that region<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
was the place where it originated. But this must for
the present remain doubtful. What we regard as certain
is that it was from France, and from Normandy in
particular, that it was introduced into the British Isles;
and to those islands we must now turn.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />
<span class="smaller">THE CASTLES OF THE NORMANS IN ENGLAND</span></h2>

<p>In this chapter we propose to give a list, in alphabetical
order for convenience of reference, of the castles which
are known to have existed in England in the 11th century,
because they are mentioned either in Domesday Book,
or in charters of the period, or in some contemporary
chronicle.<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> We do not for a moment suppose that this
catalogue of eighty-four castles is a complete list of those
which were built in England in the reigns of William I. and
William II. We have little doubt that all the castles in
the county towns, such as Leicester, Northampton, and
Guildford, and those which we hear of first as the seats
of important nobles in the reign of Henry II., such as
Marlborough, Groby, Bungay, Ongar, were castles built
shortly after the Conquest, nearly all of them being
places which have (or had) mottes. Domesday Book
only mentions fifty castles in England and Wales,<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
it is well known that the Survey is as capricious in its
mention of castles as in its mention of churches. It is
possible that further research in charters which the
writer has been unable to examine may furnish additional
castles, but the list now given may be regarded as
complete as far as materials generally accessible will
allow.<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> One of the castles mentioned (Richard&rsquo;s Castle)
and probably two others (Hereford and Ewias) existed
before the Conquest; they were the work of those
Norman friends of Edward the Confessor whom he
endowed with lands in England.</p>

<p>Out of this list of eighty-four castles we shall find
that no less than seventy-one have or had mottes. The
exceptions are the Tower of London, Colchester,
Pevensey, and Chepstow, where a stone keep was part
of the original design, and a motte was therefore
unnecessary: Bamborough, Peak, and Tynemouth,
where the site was sufficiently defended by precipices:
Carlisle and Richmond, whose original design is unknown
to us: Belvoir, Dover, Exeter, and Monmouth,
which might on many grounds be counted as motte-castles,
but as the evidence is not conclusive, we do
not mark them as such; but even if we leave them out,
with the other exceptions, we shall find that nearly 86
per cent. of our list of castles of the 11th century are of
the motte-and-bailey type.</p>

<p>About forty-three of these castles are attached to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
towns. Of these, less than a third are placed inside
the Roman walls or the Saxon or Danish earthworks
of the towns, while at least two-thirds are wholly or
partly outside these enclosures.<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> This circumstance is
important, because the position outside the town indicates
the mistrust of an invader, not the confidence of a
native prince. In the only two cases where we know
anything of the position of the residence of the Saxon
kings we find it in the middle of the city.<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> Even when
the castle is inside the town walls it is almost invariably
close to the walls, so that an escape into the country
might always be possible.<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

<p>Of the towns or manors in which these castles were
situated, Domesday Book gives us the value in King
Edward&rsquo;s and King William&rsquo;s time in sixty-two instances.
In forty-five cases the value has risen; in twelve it has
fallen; in five it is stationary. Evidently something has
caused a great increase of prosperity in these cases, and
it can hardly be anything else than the impetus given to
trade through the security afforded by a Norman castle.</p>

<p>Our list shows that Mr Clark&rsquo;s confident statement,
that the moated mounds were the centres of large and
important estates in Saxon times, was a dream. Out
of forty-one mottes in country districts, thirty-six are
found in places which were quite insignificant in King
Edward&rsquo;s day, and only five can be said to occupy the
centres of important Saxon manors.<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>In the table in the <a href="#SCHEDULE_OF_ENGLISH_CASTLES_KNOWN_TO_DATE_FROM">Appendix</a>, the area occupied by
the original baileys of the castles in this list has
been measured accurately by a planimeter, from the
25-in. Ordnance maps, in all cases in which that was
possible.<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> This table proves that the early Norman
castles were very small in area, suitable only for the
personal defence of a chieftain who had only a small
force at his disposal, and absolutely unsuited for a
people in the tribal state of development, like the
ancient Britons, or for the scheme of national defence
inaugurated by Alfred and Edward. We may remark
here that in not a single case is any masonry which
is certainly early Norman to be found on one of these
mottes; where the date can be ascertained, the stonework
is invariably later than the 11th century.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abergavenny</span> (<a href="#Fig_8">Fig. 8</a>).&mdash;This castle, being in
Monmouthshire, must be included in our list. The
earliest notice of it is a document stating that Hamelin
de Ballon gave the church and chapel of the castle of
Abergavenny, and the land for making a <i>bourg</i>, and an
oven of their own, to the Abbey of St Vincent at
Le Mans.<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

<p>The castle occupies a pointed spur at the S. end
of the town, whose walls converge so as to include the
castle as part of the defence. The motte has been
much altered during recent years, and is crowned by
a modern building; but a plan in <i>Coxe&rsquo;s Tour in
Monmouthshire</i>, 1800, shows it in its original round
form. The bailey is roughly of a pentagonal shape,
covering 1 acre, and is defended by a curtain wall with
mural towers and a gatehouse. The ditch on the W.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
and N. is much filled in and obscured by the
encroachment of the town. On the E. the ground
descends in a steep scarp, which merges into those of
the headland on which the motte is placed.<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arundel</span> (<a href="#Fig_8">Fig. 8</a>).&mdash;&ldquo;The castrum of Arundel,&rdquo;
says Domesday Book, &ldquo;paid 40<i>s.</i> in King Edward&rsquo;s
time from a certain mill, and 20<i>s.</i> from three boardlands
(or feorm-lands), and 2<i>s.</i> from one pasture. Now,
between the town feorm and the water-gate and the
ships&rsquo; dues, it pays 12<i>l.</i>&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> <i>Castrum</i> in Domesday nearly
always means a castle; yet the description here given
is certainly that of a town and not of a castle.
We must therefore regard it as an instance of the
fluctuating meaning which both <i>castrum</i> and <i>castellum</i>
had in the 11th century.<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> Arundel is one of the towns
mentioned in the &ldquo;Burghal Hidage.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> But even accepting
that the description in Domesday refers to the town,
we can have very little doubt that the original earthen
castle was reared by Roger de Montgomeri, to whom
William I. gave the Rapes of Arundel and Chichester,
and whom he afterwards made Earl of Shrewsbury.<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
Roger had contributed sixty ships to William&rsquo;s fleet,
and both he and his sons were highly favoured and
trusted by William, until the sons forfeited that
confidence. We shall see afterwards that their names
are connected with several important castles of the
early Norman settlement. We shall see also that the
Rapes into which Sussex was divided&mdash;Chichester,
Arundel, Bramber, Lewes, Pevensey, and Hastings&mdash;were
all furnished with Norman castles, each with the
characteristic motte, except Pevensey, which had a
stone keep. Each of these castles, at the time of the
Survey, defended a port by which direct access could
be had to Normandy. It was to protect his base
that William fortified these important estuaries, and
committed them to the keeping of some of the most
prominent of the Norman leaders.</p>

<p>The castle stands on the end of a high and narrow
ridge of the South Downs, above the town of Arundel.
It consists of an oblong ward, covering 4&frac12; acres, in the
middle of which, but on the line of the west wall, is a
large motte, about 70 feet high, surrounded by its own
ditch. The lower and perhaps original bailey is only
2 acres in extent. Round the top of the motte is a
slightly oval wall, of the kind called by Mr Clark a
shell keep. We have elsewhere expressed our doubts of
the correctness of this term.<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> In all the more important
castles we find that the keep on top of the motte has a
small ward attached to it, and Arundel is no exception
to this rule; it has the remains of a tower, as well as
the wall round the motte. The tower is a small one,
but it is large enough for the king&rsquo;s chamber in times
which were not extravagant in domestic architecture.
It is probable that this tower, and the stone wall round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
the motte are the work of Henry II., as he spent nearly
340<i>l.</i> on this castle between the years 1170 and 1187.
His work consisted chiefly of a wall, a king&rsquo;s chamber,
a chapel, and a tower.<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> The wall of the motte corresponds
in style to the work of the middle of his reign;
it is built of flints, but cased with Caen stone brought
from Normandy, and has Norman buttresses. The
original Norman doorway on the south side (now walled
up) has the chevron moulding, which shows that it is
not earlier than the 12th century. The tower, which we
may assume to be the tower of Henry II.&rsquo;s records, has
a round arched entrance, and contains a chapel and a
chamber (now ruined) besides a well chamber.</p>

<p>There is earlier Norman work still remaining in the
bailey, namely, the fine gateway, which though of plain
and severe Norman, is larger and loftier than the early
work of that style, and of superior masonry.<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> The one
Pipe Roll of Henry I. which we possess shows that he
spent 78<i>l.</i> 6<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> on the castle in 1130, and possibly
this refers to this gatehouse.<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> We know that Henry
was a great builder, but so was the former owner of this
castle, Robert Belesme, son of Roger de Montgomeri.</p>

<p>The value of the town of Arundel had greatly
increased since the Conquest, at the time of the
Domesday Survey.<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bamborough</span>, Northumberland.&mdash;We first hear of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
this castle in the reign of Rufus, when it was defended
against the king by Robert Mowbray, the rebel Earl of
Northumberland; but there can be little doubt that the
earliest castle on this natural bastion was built in the
Conqueror&rsquo;s reign. In the 13th century certain lands
were held by the tenure of supplying wood to the castle
of Bamborough, and it was declared that this obligation
had existed ever since the time of William I.<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> William
certainly found no castle there, for Bamborough had
fallen into utter ruin and desolation by the middle of
the 11th century.<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> William&rsquo;s hold on Northumberland
was too precarious to give opportunity for so long and
costly a work as the building of a stone keep. It is
more probable that a strong wooden castle was the
fortress of the governors of Northumberland under the
first Norman kings, and that the present stone keep was
built in Henry II.&rsquo;s reign.<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> There is no motte at
Bamborough, nor was one needed on a site which is
itself a natural motte, more precipitous and defensible
than any artificial hill.<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> As the Domesday Survey does
not extend to Northumberland, we have no statement
of the value of Bamborough. The area of the castle is
4&frac34; acres.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Barnstaple</span>, Devon (<a href="#Fig_9">Fig. 9</a>).&mdash;This castle is not
mentioned in Domesday, but the town belonged to
Judhael, one of the followers of the Conqueror, whose
name suggests a Breton origin. William gave him
large estates in Devon and Cornwall. A charter of
Judhael&rsquo;s to the priory which he founded at Barnstaple
makes mention of the castle.<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> Barnstaple, at the head
of the estuary of the Taw, was a borough at Domesday,
and the castle was placed inside the town walls.<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> The
motte remains in good condition; the winding walks
which now lead to the top are certainly no part of the
original plan, but are generally found in cases where the
motte has been incorporated in a garden. There was
formerly a stone keep, of which no vestige remains.<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>
The castle seems to have formed the apex of a town
of roughly triangular shape. The bailey can just be
traced, and must have covered 1&#8531; acres.</p>

<p>The former value of Barnstaple is not given in the
Survey, so we cannot tell whether it had risen or not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belvoir</span>, Leicester.&mdash;This castle was founded by
the Norman Robert de Todeni, who died in 1088.<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> It
stands on a natural hill, so steep and isolated that it
might be called a natural motte. The first castle was
destroyed by King John, and the modernising of the
site has entirely destroyed any earthworks which
may have existed on the hill. There appears to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
been a shell wall, from the descriptions given by
Nicholls and Leland.<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> It was situated in the manor of
Bottesdene, a manor of no great importance, but which
had risen in value at the date of the Survey.<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Berkeley</span>, or <span class="smcap">Ness</span>.&mdash;The identity of Berkeley Castle
with the Ness castle of Domesday may be regarded as
certain. All that the Survey says about it is: &ldquo;In
Ness there are five hides belonging to Berkeley, which
Earl William put out to make a little castle.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> Earl
William is William FitzOsbern, the trusty friend and
counsellor of the Conqueror, who had made him Earl
of Herefordshire. He had also authority over the north
and west of England during William&rsquo;s first absence in
Normandy, and part of the commission he received from
William was to build castles where they were needed.<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a>
Berkeley was a royal manor with a large number of
berewicks, and the probable meaning of the passage in
Domesday is that Earl William removed the <i>geldability</i>
of the five hides occupying the peninsula or <i>ness</i> which
stretches from Berkeley to the Severn, bounded on the
south by the Little Avon, and appropriated these lands
to the upkeep of a small castle. This castle can hardly
have been placed anywhere but at Berkeley, for there is
no trace of any other castle in the district.<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> Earl
Godwin had sometimes resided at Berkeley, but probably
his residence there was the monastery which by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
evil means had come into his hands;<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> for we never hear
of any castle in connection with Godwin. But a
Norman motte exists at Berkeley, though buried in the
stone shell built by Henry II. Mr Clark remarks: &ldquo;If
the masonry of Berkeley Castle were removed, its
remains would show a mound of earth, and attached to
three sides of it a platform, the whole encircled with a
ditch or scarp.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> The motte raised by Earl William
has, in fact, been revetted with a stone shell of the 12th
century, whose bold chevron ornament over the entrance
gives evidence of its epoch. What is still more remarkable
is that documentary evidence exists to fix the date
of this transformation. A charter of Henry II. is
preserved at Berkeley Castle, in which he grants the
manor to Robert Fitzhardinge, pledging himself at the
same time to fortify a castle there, according to Robert&rsquo;s
wish.<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> Robert&rsquo;s wish probably was to possess a stone
keep, like those which had been rising in so many
places during the 12th century. But there had been a
Norman lord at Berkeley before Fitzhardinge, Roger
de Berkeley, whose representatives only lost the manor
through having taken sides with Stephen in the civil
war.<a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> This Roger no doubt occupied the wooden castle
on the motte built by William FitzOsbern. Henry II.&rsquo;s
shell was probably the first masonry connected with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
the castle. This remarkable keep is nearly circular,
and has three round turrets and one oblong. As the
latter, Thorpe&rsquo;s Tower, was rebuilt in Edward III.&rsquo;s
reign, it probably took the place of a round tower. The
keep is built of rubble, and its Norman buttresses (it
has several later ones) project about a foot. The cross
loopholes in the walls are undoubtedly insertions of the
time of Edward III. The buildings in the bailey are
chiefly of the time of Edward III., but the bailey walls
have some Norman buttresses, and are probably of the
same date as the keep.<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> This bailey is nearly square,
and the motte, which is in one corner, encroaches upon
about a quarter of it. The small size of the area
which it encloses, not much more than half an
acre, corresponds to the statement of Domesday
Book that it was &ldquo;a little castle.&rdquo; There is no trace
of the usual ditch surrounding the motte, and the
smallness of the bailey makes it unlikely that there
ever was one. A second bailey has been added
to the first,<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> and the whole is surrounded on three
sides by a moat, the fourth side having formerly had
a steep descent into swamps, which formed sufficient
protection.<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a></p>

<p>There is no statement in the Survey of the value of
Ness, but the whole manor of Berkeley had risen since
the Conquest.<a name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Berkhampstead</span>, Herts (<a href="#Fig_9">Fig. 9</a>).&mdash;Mr D. H.
Montgomerie rightly calls this a magnificent example of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
an earthwork fortress.<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> It is first mentioned in a
charter of Richard I., which recapitulates the original
charter of William, son of Robert, Count of Mortain, in
which he gives the chapel of this castle to the Abbey of
Grestein in Normandy.<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> We may, therefore, with all
probability look upon this as one of the castles built by
the Conqueror&rsquo;s half-brother. And this will account for
the exceptional strength of the work, which comprises a
motte 40 feet high, ditched round (formerly), and a
bailey of 2&#8532; acres, surrounded not only with the usual
ditch and banks, but with a second ditch outside the
counterscarp bank, which encircles both motte and
bailey. At two important points in its line, this counterscarp
bank is enlarged into mounds which have evidently
once carried wooden towers;<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> if this arrangement
belonged to the original plan, as it most probably did,
it confirms a remark which we have made elsewhere
as to the early use of wooden mural towers. Works
in masonry were added to the motte and the bailey
banks in the 12th, 13th, and 14th centuries. There
are traces of a semicircular earthwork outside the
second ditch on the west, which appears to have
formed a barbican. But the most exceptional thing
about this castle is the series of earthen platforms
on the north and east, connected by a bank, and
closely investing the external ditch, which were formerly
supposed to form part of the castle works. Mr
W. St John Hope has suggested the far more plausible
theory that they were the siege platforms erected
by Louis, the Dauphin of France, in 1216. We are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
told that his engines kept up a most destructive fire
of stones.<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></p>

<p>The value of the manor of Berkhampstead had considerably
decreased, even since the Count of Mortain
received it.<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bishop&rsquo;s Stortford</span>, Herts (<a href="#Fig_9">Fig. 9</a>).&mdash;Waytemore
Castle is the name given to the large oval motte at this
place, which is evidently the site of the castle of
&ldquo;Estorteford,&rdquo; given by William the Conqueror to
Maurice, Bishop of London.<a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> The manor of Stortford
had been bought from King William by Maurice&rsquo;s
predecessor, William, who had been one of the Norman
favourites of Edward the Confessor.<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> He may have
built this castle, but he cannot have built it till after the
Conquest, as the land did not belong to his see till then.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The castle consists of a large oval motte, 250 × 200
feet at its base, rising 40 feet above the marshes of the
river Stort, and crowned by a keep with walls of flint
rubble, 12 feet thick. On the S. of the motte there
are traces of a pentagonal bailey, covering 2&frac12; acres. It
is enclosed on four sides by the narrow streams which
intersect the marshes. The dry ditch on the fifth side,
facing the motte, is discernible. The castle abuts on
the road called The Causeway, which crosses the valley;
it is in a good position to command both road and
river.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> The value of the manor had gone down at
Domesday.<a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bourn</span>, Lincolnshire (<a href="#Fig_10">Fig. 10</a>).&mdash;The manor of Bourn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
or Brune appears to have been much split up amongst
various owners at the time of Domesday. A Breton
named Oger held the demesne.<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> A charter of Picot,
the Sheriff of Cambridgeshire, a person often mentioned
in Domesday Book, gives the church of Brune and the
chapel of the castle to the priory which he had founded
near the castle of Cambridge&mdash;afterwards removed to
Barnwell.<a name="FNanchor_291" id="FNanchor_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> Bourn was the centre of a large soke in
Anglo-Saxon times. Leland mentions the &ldquo;Grete
Diches, and the Dungeon Hill of the ancient Castel,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_292" id="FNanchor_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a>
but very little of the remains is now visible, and the
motte has been almost removed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The castle lies in flat ground, well watered by
springs and streams. The motte was placed at the
southern apex of a roughly oval bailey, from which it
was separated by its own wet ditch, access being
obtained through a gatehouse which stood on the narrow
neck by which this innermost enclosure, at its N.W.
end, joined the principal bailey, which, in its turn,
was embraced on all sides but the S. by a second
and concentric bailey, also defended by a wet ditch,
which broadens out at the S.W. corner into St
Peter&rsquo;s Pool. There is another enclosure beyond this
which may be of later date. The inner bailey covers
3 acres. Very little is now left of the motte, but a plan
made in 1861 showed it to be fairly perfect,<a name="FNanchor_293" id="FNanchor_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> and some
slight remains of the gatehouse were excavated in that
year. The castle is on the line of the Roman road from
Peterborough to Sleaford, and close to the Roman Car-Dyke.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></p>

<p>The value of Bourn had risen at Domesday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bramber</span>, Sussex (<a href="#Fig_10">Fig. 10</a>).&mdash;Of the manor of
Washington, in which Bramber is situated, the
Survey says that it formerly paid geld for fifty-nine
hides; and in one of these hides sits the castle of
Bramber.<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> It must not be imagined that the castle
<i>occupied</i> a whole hide, which according to the latest
computations would average about 120 acres. It is
evident that there had been some special arrangement
between the King and William de Braose, the Norman
tenant-in-chief, by which the whole geld of the manor
had been remitted. The Domesday scribe waxes almost
pathetic over the loss to the fisc of this valuable prey.
&ldquo;It used to be ad firmam for 100<i>l.</i>,&rdquo; he says. The
manor of Washington belonged to Gurth, the brother of
Harold, before the Conquest, but it is clear that
Bramber was not the <i>caput</i> of the manor in Saxon times;
nor was Washington the centre of a large soke.
Bramber Castle was constructed to defend the estuary
of the river, now known as the Adur, one of the waterways
to Normandy already alluded to.</p>

<p>The castle occupies a natural hill which forms on the
top a pear-shaped area of 3 acres. Towards the middle
rises an artificial motte about 30 feet high; there is no
sign of a special ditch around it, except that the ground
sinks slightly at its base. The bailey is surrounded by
a very neatly built wall of pebbles and flints, laid
herring-bone-wise in places, which does not stand on
an earthen bank. The absence of this bank makes it
likely, though of course not certain, that this wall was
the original work of De Braose; the stones of which it
is composed would be almost as easily obtained as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
earth for a bank. On the line of the wall, just east of
the entrance, stands a tall fragment of an early Norman
tower. The workmanship of this tower, which is also of
flints laid herring-bone-wise, with quoins of ashlar, so
strongly resembles that of the neighbouring church that
it seems obvious that both were built at about the same
time.<a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> The church is dedicated to St Nicholas, who was
worshipped in Normandy as early as 1067;<a name="FNanchor_297" id="FNanchor_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> it was
probably the Normans who introduced his worship into
England. Both church and tower are undoubtedly early
Norman. The motte shows no sign of masonry.</p>

<p>The value of the manor of Washington had slightly
risen since the Conquest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bristol.</span>&mdash;Robert, Earl of Gloucester, the Empress
Matilda&rsquo;s half-brother and great champion, is always
credited with the building of Bristol Castle; but this is
one of the many instances in which the man who first
rebuilds a castle in stone receives the credit of being the
original founder.<a name="FNanchor_298" id="FNanchor_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> For it is certain that there was a
castle at Bristol long before the days of Earl Robert, as
the <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i> mentions it in 1088, when it
was held by Geoffrey, Bishop of Coutances, and Robert
Curthose against William II.; and Symeon of Durham,
in the same year, speaks of it as a &ldquo;castrum fortissimum.&rdquo;
Bishop Geoffrey held Bristol at the date of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
the Domesday Survey, and he probably built the castle
by William&rsquo;s orders.<a name="FNanchor_299" id="FNanchor_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> It was completely destroyed in
1655 (only a few 13th century arches in a private
house now remain), and no trustworthy plan has been
preserved, but there is clear evidence that it was a
motte-and-bailey castle of the usual Norman type.<a name="FNanchor_300" id="FNanchor_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> In
Stephen&rsquo;s reign it was described as standing on a very
great <i>agger</i>.<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> An <i>agger</i> does not necessarily mean a
motte, but it is often used for one, and there is other
evidence which shows that this is its meaning here. A
Perambulation of the bounds of Bristol in 1373 shows
that the south-western part of the castle ditch, which
enclosed the site of the keep, was called <i>le Mot-dich</i>;
which should certainly be translated the ditch of the
motte, and not, as Seyer translates it, the moat ditch.<a name="FNanchor_302" id="FNanchor_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a>
Finally, the description of the castle in 1642 by Major
Wood, says: &ldquo;The castle stood upon a lofty steep mount,
that was not minable, as Lieutenant Clifton informed
me, for he said the mount whereon the castle stood was
of an earthy substance for a certain depth, but below
that a firm strong rock, and that he had searched
purposely with an auger and found it so in all parts.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_303" id="FNanchor_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a>
He goes on to describe the wall of the bailey as resting
on an earthen rampart, testifying to the wooden
stockade of the first castle. The great tower of Earl
Robert appears to have been placed on the motte, which
must have been of considerable size, as it held not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
the keep, but a courtyard, a chapel, and the constable&rsquo;s
house, besides several towers on its walls. The whole
area of the castle was very nearly 4 acres.<a name="FNanchor_304" id="FNanchor_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a></p>

<p>Bristol Castle was no doubt originally a royal castle,
though Earl Robert of Gloucester held it in right of his
wife, who had inherited it from her father, Robert Fitz
Hamon; but the crown did not abdicate its claim upon
it, and after the troubles of 1174, Henry II. caused the
son of Earl Robert to surrender the keep into his
hands.<a name="FNanchor_305" id="FNanchor_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></p>

<p>Seyer very pertinently remarks that Bristol Castle
&ldquo;was erected with a design hostile to the town; for it
occupies the peninsula between two rivers, along which
was the direct and original communication between the
town and the main part of Gloucestershire.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_306" id="FNanchor_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> It was
outside the city, and was not under its jurisdiction till
James I. granted this authority by charter.<a name="FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> The value
T. R. E. is not given in Domesday Book.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Buckingham.</span>&mdash;The only mention of this castle as
existing in the 11th century is in the <i>Gesta Herewardi</i>,<a name="FNanchor_308" id="FNanchor_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a>
an undated work which is certainly in great part a
romance, but as it is written by some one who evidently
had local knowledge, we may probably trust him for the
existence of Buckingham Castle at that date; especially
as Buckingham was a county town, and one of the
boroughs of the Burghal Hidage, the very place which
we should expect to find occupied by a Norman castle.
This writer speaks of the castle as belonging to Ivo de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
Taillebois; this is not inconsistent with the fact shown
by Domesday Book, that the borough belonged to the
king. That it was a motte-and-bailey castle is indicated
by Speed&rsquo;s map of Buckingham in 1611; he speaks of
the &ldquo;high hill,&rdquo; though he only indicates it slightly in
his plan, with a shield-shaped bailey. Brayley states
that the present church is &ldquo;proudly exalted on the
summit of an artificial mount, anciently occupied by a
castle.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_309" id="FNanchor_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a></p>

<p>The castle hill occupies a strong position on the
neck of land made by a bend of the river; it extends
nearly half-way across it, and commands both town and
river. The original earthworks of the castle were
destroyed and levelled for the erection of a church in
1777, but the large oval hill remains, having a flat
summit about 2 acres in extent, and about 30 feet above
the town below. Its sides descend in steep scarps
behind the houses on all sides but the north-east.
There can be no doubt that the motte has been
lowered, and thus enlarged, in order to build the church.
The foundations of a stone castle were found in digging
a cellar on the slope of the motte.<a name="FNanchor_310" id="FNanchor_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></p>

<p>The value of Buckingham had considerably risen at
the date of Domesday.<a name="FNanchor_311" id="FNanchor_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caerleon</span>, Monmouthshire (<a href="#Fig_11">Fig. 11</a>).&mdash;Domesday
Book speaks of the <i>castellaria</i> of Caerleon.<a name="FNanchor_312" id="FNanchor_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> A <i>castellaria</i>
appears to have meant a district in which the land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
was held by the service of castle-guard in a neighbouring
castle. The Survey goes on to say that this
land was waste in the time of King Edward, and when
William de Scohies, the Domesday tenant, received it;
<i>now</i> it is worth 40s. <i>Wasta</i>, Mr Round has remarked,
is one of the pitfalls of the Survey. Perhaps we shall
not be far wrong if we say that in a general way it
means that there was nobody there to pay geld. When
this occurs in a town it may point to the devastations
committed at the Conquest; but when it occurs in the
country, and when it is accompanied by so clear a statement
that the land which was <i>wasta</i> in King Edward&rsquo;s
time and at the Conquest is now producing revenue, the
inference would seem to be clear that the castle of
Caerleon was built on uninhabited land. Caerleon, however,
had been a great city in Roman times, and had
kept up its importance at least till the days of Edgar,
when it is twice mentioned in Welsh history.<a name="FNanchor_313" id="FNanchor_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> It must
therefore have gone downhill very rapidly. Giraldus
mentions among the ruins of Roman greatness which
were to be seen in his day, a gigantic tower, and this is
commonly supposed to have belonged to the castle.<a name="FNanchor_314" id="FNanchor_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> It
certainly did not, for Giraldus is clearly speaking of a
Roman tower, and the motte of the Norman castle not
only has no signs of masonry, but has been thrown up
over the ruins of a Roman villa which had been burnt.<a name="FNanchor_315" id="FNanchor_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a>
The motte and other remains of the castle are outside
the Roman <i>castrum</i>, between it and the river. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
bailey is roughly pentagonal, and covers 4&frac34; acres.
The manor of Caerleon was waste T. R. E. and had

<p><span class="smcap">Cambridge.</span>&mdash;Ordericus tells us that William built
this castle on his return from his first visit to Yorkshire
in 1068,<a name="FNanchor_317" id="FNanchor_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> and Domesday Book states that twenty-seven
houses were destroyed to make room for the castle.<a name="FNanchor_318" id="FNanchor_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a>
There can hardly be a clearer statement that the castle
was entirely new. We have already seen that there is
some probability that Cambridge was first fortified by
the Danes; for though it has been assumed to be a
Roman castrum, no Roman remains have ever been
found there, and the names which suggest Roman
occupation, Chesterton and Grantchester, are at some
distance from Cambridge. The castle, according to Mr
St John Hope&rsquo;s plan,<a name="FNanchor_319" id="FNanchor_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> was placed inside this enclosure,
and the destruction of the houses to make room for it is
thus explained. The motte and a portion of the bank of
the bailey are all that now remain of the castle, but the
valuable ancient maps republished by Mr Hope show
that the motte had its own ditch, and that the bailey was
rectangular. There was formerly a round tower on the
motte, which, if it had the cross-loop-holes and machicolations
represented in the print published in 1575, was
certainly not of Norman date. The area of the bailey
was 4&frac14; acres.<a name="FNanchor_320" id="FNanchor_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> The castle was a royal one, and like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
many royal castles, went early to ruin. Henry IV. gave
the materials of the hall to the master and wardens of
King&rsquo;s Hall for building their chapel.</p>

<p>The value of Cambridge T. R. W. is not given in
Domesday Book.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Canterbury.</span>&mdash;Domesday Book only mentions this
castle incidentally in connection with an exchange of
land: &ldquo;The archbishop has seven houses and the
abbot of St Augustine fourteen for the exchange of
the castle.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_321" id="FNanchor_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> It has been too hastily assumed
that it was a pre-Conquest castle which was thus
exchanged for twenty-one houses; but anyone who
knows the kind of relations which existed chronically
between the archbishop of Canterbury and the abbot
of St Augustine&rsquo;s will perceive that it was an impossibility
that these two potentates should have held
a castle in common. It was the land for the castle,
not the castle itself, which the king got from these
ecclesiastics. This is rendered clear by a passage in
the Chartulary of St Augustine&rsquo;s, which tells us that
the king, who was mesne lord of the city of Canterbury,
had lost the rent of thirty-two houses through
the exchange of the castle: seven having gone to the
archbishop, fourteen to the abbot, and eleven having
been destroyed in making the ditch of the castle.<a name="FNanchor_322" id="FNanchor_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a>
There can scarcely be any doubt that the hillock now
known by the ridiculous name of Dane John is the motte
of this original castle of the Conqueror. Its proper
name, the Dungeon Hill, which it bore till the 16th and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
even the 18th century,<a name="FNanchor_323" id="FNanchor_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> shows what its origin was; it was
the hill on which stood the dungeon or donjon of a
Norman castle.<a name="FNanchor_324" id="FNanchor_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> The name Dane John is not so much a
corruption as a deliberate perversion introduced by the
antiquary Somner about 1640, under the idea that the
Danes threw up the hill&mdash;an idea for which there is not
the slightest historical evidence.<a name="FNanchor_325" id="FNanchor_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> We have seen that
there is no reason to think that the Danes ever
constructed fortifications of this kind, and their connection
with this earthwork is due to one of those guesses,
too common in English archæology, which have no
scientific basis whatever.</p>

<p>Somner makes the important statement that this
earthwork was originally outside the city walls. His
words are:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;I am persuaded (and so may easily, I think, anyone be that well
observes the place) that the works both within and without the present wall
of the city were not counterworks one against the other, as the vulgar
opinion goes, but were sometimes all one entire plot containing about 3
acres of ground, of a triangular form (the outwork) with a mount or hill
entrenched round within it; and that when first made or cast up it lay
wholly without the city wall; and hath been (the hill or mount, and most
part also of the outwork), for the city&rsquo;s more security, taken in and walled
since; that side of the trench encompassing the mound now lying without
and under the wall fitly meeting with the rest of the city ditch, after either
side of the earthwork was cut through to make way for it, at the time of the
city&rsquo;s inditching.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_326" id="FNanchor_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It is not often we are so fortunate as to have so clear
a description of an earthwork which has almost entirely
disappeared; but the description is confirmed by
Stukeley and Hasted, and down to the making of the
Chatham and Dover railway in 1860 the earthworks of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
the part of the bailey which was left outside the city wall
were still to be seen, and were noticed by Mr G. T.
Clark.<a name="FNanchor_327" id="FNanchor_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> It is clear that Somner&rsquo;s description corresponds
exactly, even in the detail of size, to the type of a motte-and-bailey
castle.</p>

<p>There are certain facts, which have not been put
together before, which enable us to make a very probable
guess as to the date at which this ancient castle was cut
through by the newer city bank. The walls of Canterbury
have never yet received so careful an examination
as those of Rochester have had from the Rev. Greville
Livett;<a name="FNanchor_328" id="FNanchor_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> but the researches of Mr Pilbrow about thirty
years ago showed that the original Roman walls included
a very small area, which would leave both the motte and
the Plantagenet castle outside.<a name="FNanchor_329" id="FNanchor_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> Certain entries in the
<i>Close Rolls</i> show that the fortification of the town of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
Canterbury was going on in the years 1215-1225.<a name="FNanchor_330" id="FNanchor_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> But
it is too often forgotten that where a wall stands on an
earthen bank it is a clear proof that before the wall was
built there was a wooden stockade in its place. Now
the portion of the city wall which encloses the Dane John
stands on an earthen bank; so, indeed, does the whole
wall from the Northgate to the castle. It is clear that
this piece of bank cannot have been made till the first
Norman castle, represented by the earthwork, was
abandoned; and fortunately we have some evidence
which suggests a date for the change. In the <i>Pipe Rolls</i>
of Henry II.&rsquo;s reign there are yearly entries, beginning
in 1168, of 5s. paid to Adeliza Fitzsimon &ldquo;for
the exchange of her land which is in the castle of
Canterbury.&rdquo; There can be little doubt that this land
was purchased to build the great Plantagenet castle
whose splendid keep was once one of the finest in
England.<a name="FNanchor_331" id="FNanchor_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> The portion of the castle wall which can
still be seen does not stand on an earthen bank, an
indication (though not a proof) that the castle was on a
new site. Henry II. was a great builder of stone keeps,
but he seldom placed them on artificial mottes. It is no
uncommon thing to find an old motte-and-bailey castle
abandoned for a better or larger site close at hand.<a name="FNanchor_332" id="FNanchor_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a></p>

<p>The bailey of the second castle, according to
Hasted, extended almost to the Dane John, which is
about 800 feet from the present keep. The part of the
older castle which lay outside the new city bank was
possessed by a family of the name of Chiche from the
time of Henry II. to that of Edward IV., while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
Dungeon Hill itself remained royal property.<a name="FNanchor_333" id="FNanchor_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> That
the new bank was Henry II.&rsquo;s work we may conjecture
from the passages in the <i>Pipe Rolls</i>, which show that
between the years 1166 and 1173 he spent about £30
in enclosing the city of Canterbury and making a gate.
We are therefore not without grounds for concluding
that Henry II. was the first to enlarge the city by
taking in the Dane John, cutting through the ancient
bailey, and at the same time enclosing a piece of land
for a new stone castle.<a name="FNanchor_334" id="FNanchor_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> The very small sum paid for the
city gate (11s., equal to about £11 of our money)
suggests that the gate put up by Henry II. was a
wooden gateway in the new stockaded bank. The
stone walls and towers which were afterwards placed
on the bank are of much later date than his reign.<a name="FNanchor_335" id="FNanchor_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>The Dungeon Hill appears to have been used for
the last time as a fortification in 1643, when ordnance
was placed upon it, and it was ordered to be guarded
by the householders.<a name="FNanchor_336" id="FNanchor_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> In 1790 it was converted into
a pleasure-ground for the city; the wide and deep
ditch which had surrounded it was filled up, and
serpentine walks cut to lead up to the summit.
Brayley says that &ldquo;the ancient and venerable character
of this eminence was wholly destroyed by incongruous
additions.&rdquo; Still, enough remains to show that it was
once a very fine motte, such as we might expect the
Conqueror to raise to hold in check one of the most
important cities of his new realm.</p>

<p>The value of Canterbury had increased from 51<i>l.</i> to
54<i>l.</i> since the days of King Edward.<a name="FNanchor_337" id="FNanchor_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carisbrooke</span>, Isle of Wight (<a href="#Fig_11">Fig. 11</a>).&mdash;There can
be no doubt that this is the castle spoken of in Domesday
Book under the manor of Alwinestone. Carisbrooke
is in the immediate neighbourhood of Alvington. The
language in which the Survey speaks of this manor is
worthy of note. &ldquo;The king holds Alwinestone: Donnus
held it. It then paid geld as two and a half hides: now
as two hides, because the castle sits in one virgate.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_338" id="FNanchor_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a>
Certain entries similar to this in other places seem to
indicate that there was some remission of geld granted
on the building of a castle;<a name="FNanchor_339" id="FNanchor_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> but as here the king was
himself the owner, the remission must have been
granted to his tenants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>The original castle of Carisbrooke consists of a high
motte, ditched round, placed at the corner of a parallelogram
with rounded corners. This bailey, covering 2&frac34;
acres, is surrounded by high banks, which testify to the
former presence of a wooden stockade. There is
another bailey on the eastern side, called the Tilt-yard.
The excellent little local guide-book compiled by
Mr Stone calls this a British camp, but there is no
reason to believe that it was anything else than what
it appears to be&mdash;a second bailey added as the castle
grew in importance. On the motte is a shell of
polygonal form, of rubble masonry, but having quoins
of well-dressed ashlar. It is believed to be of the time
of Henry I., since the author of the <i>Gesta Stephani</i>
states that Baldwin de Redvers, son of Richard de
Redvers, to whom Henry granted the lordship of the
Isle of Wight, had a castle there splendidly built of
stone, defended by a strong fortification.<a name="FNanchor_340" id="FNanchor_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> This would
indicate that, besides the stone keep, stone walls were
added to the earthworks of the Domesday castle. The
keep is of peculiar interest, as it still retains the remains
of the old arrangements in keeps of this style, though
of much later date. The motte was opened in 1893,
and was found to be composed of alternate layers of
large and small chalk rubble.<a name="FNanchor_341" id="FNanchor_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> Little attention has
hitherto been paid to the construction of these Norman
mottes, but other instances have been noted which show
that they were often built with great care. The whole
castle, including the Tilt-yard, was surrounded with an
elaborate polygonal fortification in Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign,
when the Spanish invasion was expected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>The value of the manor of Alvington had increased
at the time of the Survey, though the number of ploughs
employed had actually decreased. This increase must
have been owing to the erection of the castle, which
provided security for trade and agriculture. Alvington
was not the centre of a large soke in the Confessor&rsquo;s
time, so it is unlikely that there was any fortification
there in Saxon days.<a name="FNanchor_342" id="FNanchor_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carlisle</span>, Cumberland (<span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 12).&mdash;This castle was built
by William Rufus in 1092, when for the first time Cumberland
was brought under Norman sway. The <i>Anglo-Saxon
Chronicle</i> says, &ldquo;he repaired the <i>burh</i>, and reared
the castle,&rdquo; a passage which is sufficient of itself to show
that <i>burh</i> and castle were two quite different things.
Carlisle of course was a Roman fortress, and needed only
the repairing of its walls. The castle was a new thing,
and was placed outside the city. Its plan, which is
roughly a triangle, with the apex formed into a small
court by a ditch which (formerly) separated it from the
bailey, looks very suggestive of a previous motte and
bailey, such as we might expect the Norman king to
have thrown up. The keep is known to have been built
by David, king of Scotland, in Stephen&rsquo;s reign,<a name="FNanchor_343" id="FNanchor_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> and
it is possible that he may have removed the motte. The
castle appears to have had a wooden <i>pelum</i> or <i>palicium</i>
on its outer banks as late as 1319.<a name="FNanchor_344" id="FNanchor_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> The whole area
covers 4 acres.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Castle Acre</span>, Norfolk (<a href="#Fig_12">Fig. 12</a>).&mdash;There can be no
doubt that this castle existed in the 11th century, as
William de Warenne mentions it in the charter of
foundation of Lewes Priory, one of the most interesting
and human of monastic charters.<a name="FNanchor_345" id="FNanchor_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> The earthworks still
remaining of this castle are perhaps the finest castle
earthworks in England; the banks enclosing the bailey
are vast. The large and high motte carries a wall
of flint rubble, built outside and thus revetting the earthen
bank which formed its first defence. In the small court
thus enclosed (about 100 feet in diameter) the foundations
of an oblong keep can be discerned. A very wide ditch
surrounds the motte, and below it is a horse-shoe bailey,
about 2 acres in extent, stretching down to the former
swamps of the river Nar. On the east side of the motte
is a small half-moon annexe, with its own ditch; this
curious addition is to be found in several other motte
castles,<a name="FNanchor_346" id="FNanchor_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> and is believed to have been a work intended
to defend the approach, of the nature of a barbican. On
the west side of the motte is the village of Castle Acre,
enclosed in an oblong earthwork with an area of 10
acres. This work now goes by the name of the
Barbican, but probably this name has been extended
to it from a barbican covering the castle entrance (of
which entrance the ruins still remain). It is most likely
that this enclosure was a <i>burgus</i> attached to the castle.
Mr Harrod, who excavated the banks, found quantities
of Roman pottery, which led him to think that the work
was Roman; but as the pottery was all broken, it is
more likely that the banks were thrown up on the site
of some Roman villa.<a name="FNanchor_347" id="FNanchor_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> This earthwork has a northern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
entrance in masonry, evidently of 13th century date;
and as the scanty masonry remaining of the castle is
similar in character, it is probably all of the same date.
The area covered by the motte and the two original
baileys is 3&frac12; acres; that of the whole series of earthworks,
15 acres.</p>

<p>Acre was only a small manor in Saxon times; its
value at the time of the Survey had risen from 5<i>l.</i> to 9<i>l.</i><a name="FNanchor_348" id="FNanchor_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chepstow</span> (Estrighoel or Strigul), Monmouthshire.&mdash;Notwithstanding
the fact that there is another castle of
the name of Strigul about 9 miles from Chepstow (known
also as Troggy Castle), it is clear that Chepstow is the
castle meant by Domesday, as the entry speaks of ships
going up the river, a thing impossible at Strigul.<a name="FNanchor_349" id="FNanchor_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> The
castle occupies a narrow ridge, well defended by the
river on one side, and on the other by a valley which
separates it from the town. There are four wards, and
the last and smallest of all seemed to the writer, when
visiting the castle, to mark the site of a lowered motte.
This opinion, however, is not shared by two competent
observers, Mr Harold Sands and Mr Duncan Montgomerie,
who had much ampler opportunities for
studying the remains. This ward is now a barbican,
and the masonry upon it belongs clearly to the 13th
century; it occupies the highest ground in the castle,
and is separated from the other wards, and from the
ridge beyond it, by two ditches cut across the headland.
The adjoining court must have belonged to the earliest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
part of the castle, as it contains a very remarkable early
Norman building (splendidly restored in the 13th century)
which is regarded by most authorities as the original
hall of William FitzOsbern. It must, however, have
combined both hall and keep, otherwise the castle was
not provided with any citadel, if there was no motte.<a name="FNanchor_350" id="FNanchor_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a>
What is now the second ward has a Norman postern in
the south wall, and may have been the bailey to the keep.
All the other masonry is of the late Early English or
the Perpendicular period, and the entrance ward is
probably an addition of the 13th century. The shape
of all the baileys is roughly quadrangular, except that
of the fourth, which would be semicircular but for the
towers which make corners to it. The whole area of
the castle is 1&#8532; acres.</p>

<p>We are not told what the value of the manor was
before William FitzOsbern built his castle there, but
from the absence of this mention we may infer that the
site was waste. It paid 40<i>s.</i> in his time from ships&rsquo;
dues, 16<i>l.</i> in his son Earl Roger&rsquo;s time, and at the date
of the Survey it paid the king 12<i>l.</i><a name="FNanchor_351" id="FNanchor_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> Chepstow was not
the centre of a large soke, and it appears to have owed
all its importance to the creation of William FitzOsbern&rsquo;s
castle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chester.</span>&mdash;The statement of Ordericus, that
William I. founded this castle on his return from
his third visit to York, is sufficiently clear.<a name="FNanchor_352" id="FNanchor_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> The very
valuable paper of Mr E. W. Cox on Chester Castle<a name="FNanchor_353" id="FNanchor_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
answers most of the questions which pertain to our
present inquiry. The original castle of Chester consisted
of the motte, which still remains, though much
built over, and the small ward on the edge of which
it stands, a polygonal enclosure scarcely an acre in
extent. On the motte the vaulted basement of a tower
still remains, but the style is so obscured by whitewash
and modern accretions that it is impossible to say
whether the vaulting is not modern. The first buildings
were certainly of wood, but Mr Cox regarded some of
the existing masonry on the motte as belonging to the
12th century; and this would correspond with the entry
in the <i>Pipe Rolls</i> of 102<i>l.</i> 7<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i> spent on the castle by
Henry II. in 1159.<a name="FNanchor_354" id="FNanchor_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> The tower, nicknamed Cæsar&rsquo;s
Tower, and frequently mistaken for the keep, is shown in
Mr Cox&rsquo;s paper to be only a mural tower of the 13th
century, probably built when the first ward was
surrounded with walls and towers in masonry.<a name="FNanchor_355" id="FNanchor_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> The
large outer bailey was first added in the reign of Henry
III.<a name="FNanchor_356" id="FNanchor_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> It is further proved by Mr Cox that Chester
Castle stood outside the walls of the Roman city. The
manor of Gloverstone lay between it and the city, and
was not under the jurisdiction of the city until quite
recent times.<a name="FNanchor_357" id="FNanchor_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> This disposes of the ball set rolling by
Brompton at the end of the 13th century, and sent on
by most Chester topographers ever since, that Ethelfleda,
when she restored the Roman walls of Chester,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
enlarged their circuit so as to take in the castle. We
have already referred to this in <a href="#CHAPTER_III">Chapter III</a>.</p>

<p>Chester, as we have seen, was originally a royal
castle. And though it was naturally committed to the
keeping of the Norman earls of Chester, and under weak
kings may have been regarded by the earls as their own
property, no such claim was allowed under a strong
ruler. After the insurrection of the younger Henry,
Hugh, Earl of Chester, forfeited his lands; Henry II.
restored them to him in 1177, but was careful to keep
the castle in his own hands.<a name="FNanchor_358" id="FNanchor_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a></p>

<p>The city of Chester, Domesday Book tells us, had
greatly gone down in value when the earl received it,
probably in 1070; twenty-five houses had been destroyed.
But it had already recovered its prosperity at the date
of the Survey; there were as many houses as before, and
the ferm of the city was now let by the earl at a sum
greatly exceeding the ferm paid in King Edward&rsquo;s time.<a name="FNanchor_359" id="FNanchor_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a>
This prosperity must have been due to the security
provided for the trade of Chester by the Norman castle
and Norman rule.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clifford</span>, Herefordshire (<a href="#Fig_13">Fig. 13</a>).&mdash;It is clearly
stated by Domesday Book that William FitzOsbern
built this castle on waste land.<a name="FNanchor_360" id="FNanchor_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> At the date of the
Survey it was held by Ralph de Todeni, who had sub-let
it to the sheriff. In the many castles attributed to
William FitzOsbern, who built them as the king&rsquo;s
vicegerent, we may see an indication that the building
of castles, even on the marches of Wales, was not
undertaken without royal license. In the reign of
Henry I. Clifford Castle had already passed into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
hands of Richard Fitz Pons, the ancestor of the
celebrated house of Clifford, and one of the <i>barons</i> of
Bernard de Neufmarché, the Norman conqueror of
Brecon.<a name="FNanchor_361" id="FNanchor_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a></p>

<p>The castle has a large motte, roughly square in
shape, which must be in part artificial.<a name="FNanchor_362" id="FNanchor_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> Attached to it
on the south-west is a curious triangular ward, included
in the ditch which surrounds the motte. The masonry
on the motte is entirely of the &ldquo;Edwardian&rdquo; style, when
keepless castles were built; it consists of the remains of
a hall, and a mural tower which is too small to be called
a keep. There is also a small court, with a wall which
stands on a low bank. Below the motte is an irregular
bailey of about 2&#8531; acres, with earthen banks which do
not appear to have ever carried any masonry, though in
the middle of the court there is a small mound which
evidently covers the remains of buildings. The whole
area of the castle, including the motte and the two
baileys, is about 3&frac12; acres.</p>

<p>The value of the manor had apparently risen from
nothing to 8<i>l.</i> 5<i>s.</i> Clifford was not the centre of a
large soke.</p>

<p id="Clitheroe"><span class="smcap">Clitheroe</span>, Lancashire (<a href="#Fig_13">Fig. 13</a>).&mdash;There is no
express mention of this castle in Domesday Book, but
of two places in Yorkshire, Barnoldswick and Calton, it
is said that they are in the <i>castellate</i> of Roger the
Poitevin.<a name="FNanchor_363" id="FNanchor_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> A castellate implies a castle, and as there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
no other castle in the Craven district (to which the
words of the Survey relate) except Skipton, which did
not form part of Roger&rsquo;s property, there is no reason to
doubt that this castle was Clitheroe, which for centuries
was the centre of the Honour of that name. The whole
land between the Ribble and the Mersey had been given
by William I. to this Roger, the third son of his trusted
supporter, Earl Roger of Shrewsbury. One can understand
why William gave important frontier posts to the
energetic and unscrupulous young men of the house of
Montgomeri, one of whom was the adviser and architect
of William Rufus, another a notable warrior in
North Wales, another the conqueror of Pembrokeshire.
As it appears from the Survey that Roger&rsquo;s possessions
stretched far beyond the Ribble into Yorkshire and
Cumberland, it seems quite possible&mdash;though here we
are in the region of conjecture&mdash;that just as his father
and brothers had a free hand to conquer as they listed
from the North and South Welsh, so Roger had a
similar commission for the hilly districts still unconquered
in the north-west of England. But fortune did
not favour the Montgomeri family for long. They were
exiled from England in 1102 for siding with Robert
Curthose, and in the same year we find the castle of
Clitheroe in the hands of Robert de Lacy, lord of the
great Yorkshire fief of Pontefract.<a name="FNanchor_364" id="FNanchor_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a></p>

<p>The castle of Clitheroe stands on a lofty motte of
natural rock.<a name="FNanchor_365" id="FNanchor_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> There are no earthworks on the summit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
but a stout wall of limestone rubble without buttresses
encloses a small court, on whose south-west side stands
the keep. It is just possible that the outer wall may be
the original work of Roger, as limestone rubble would be
easier to get than earth on this rocky hill. The keep is
small, rudely built of rubble, and has neither fireplace
nor garde-robe, nor the slightest ornamental detail&mdash;not
even a string course. But in spite of the entire absence
of ornament, a decorative effect has been sought and
obtained by making the quoins, voussoirs, and lintels of
a dressed yellow sandstone. The care with which this
has been done is inconsistent with the haste with which
Roger must inevitably have constructed his first fortification,
if we suppose, as is probable, that he received the
first grant of his northern lands on William&rsquo;s return
in 1070 from his third visit to the north, when he made
that remarkable march through Lancashire to Chester
which is described by Ordericus. It seems more likely
that even if the outer wall or shell were the work of
Roger, he had only wooden buildings inside its circuit.
Dugdale attributes the building of the keep to the
second Robert de Lacy, between 1187 and 1194, and it
is probable that this date is correct.<a name="FNanchor_366" id="FNanchor_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> The bailey of
Clitheroe lay considerably below the keep, and is now
overbuilt with a modern house, offices, and garden. It
covers one acre. A Roman road up the valley of the
Ribble passes near the foot of the rock.<a name="FNanchor_367" id="FNanchor_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>As the very name of Clitheroe is not mentioned in
Domesday Book, it clearly was not an important centre
in Saxon times. The value of Blackburn Hundred, in
which Clitheroe is situated, had fallen between the
Confessor&rsquo;s time and the time when Roger received it.
It is quite possible that he never lived at Clitheroe, as
he sub-infeoffed the manor and Hundred of Blackburn
to Roger de Busli and Albert Greslet before 1086.<a name="FNanchor_368" id="FNanchor_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colchester</span>, Essex.&mdash;The remarkable keep of this
castle has been the subject of antiquarian legend for
many centuries, and Mr Clark has the merit of having
proved its early Norman origin, by its plan and architecture.
A charter of Henry I. is preserved in the
cartulary of St John&rsquo;s Abbey at Colchester, which
grants to Eudes the Dapifer &ldquo;the city of Colchester,
and the tower and the castle, and all the fortifications of
the castle, just as my father had them and my brother
and myself.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_369" id="FNanchor_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> This proves that the keep and castle
were in existence in the Conqueror&rsquo;s time; the Norman
character of the architecture proves that the keep was
not in existence earlier. We see, then, that the reason
there is no motte at Colchester is that there was a stone
keep built when first the castle was founded. As far as
we are aware, Colchester, the Tower of London, and the
recently discovered keep of Pevensey are the only certain
instances of stone keeps of the 11th century in England.</p>

<p>That one of the most important of the Conqueror&rsquo;s
castles, second only to the Tower of London, and
actually exceeding it in the area it covers, should be
found in Colchester, is not surprising, because the
Eastern counties at the time of the Conquest were not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
only the wealthiest part of the kingdom (as Domesday
Book clearly shows<a name="FNanchor_370" id="FNanchor_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a>), but they also needed special
protection from the attacks of Scandinavian enemies.
Mr Round has conjectured that the castle was built at
the time of the invasion of St Cnut, between 1080 and
1085.<a name="FNanchor_371" id="FNanchor_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a></p>

<p>The castle is built of Roman stones used over again,
with rows of tiles introduced between the courses with
much decorative effect.<a name="FNanchor_372" id="FNanchor_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> The original doorway was on
the first floor, as in most Norman keeps; but at some
after time, probably in the reign of Henry I.,<a name="FNanchor_373" id="FNanchor_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> the present
doorway was inserted; and most likely the handsome
stairway which now leads up from this basement
entrance was added, as it shows clear marks of insertion.
Henry II. was working on the walls of the castle in
1182, and it may be strongly suspected that the repairs
in ashlar, and the casing of the buttresses with ashlar,
were his work.<a name="FNanchor_374" id="FNanchor_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> One item in the accounts of Henry II.
is £50 &ldquo;for making the bailey round the castle.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_375" id="FNanchor_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a>
There were two baileys to the castle of Colchester&mdash;the
inner one, which scarcely covered 2 acres, and the outer
one, which contained about 11. The inner bailey was
enclosed at first with an earthwork and stockade, the
earthwork being thrown up over the remains of some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
Roman walls, whose line it does not follow. Afterwards
a stone wall was built on the earthwork, the foundations
of which can still be traced in the west rampart.<a name="FNanchor_376" id="FNanchor_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> The
outer bailey, which lay to the north, extended on two
sides to the Roman walls of the town; on the west side
it had a rampart and stockade. If the £50 spent by
Henry II. represents the cost of a stone wall round the
inner bailey, then the <i>palicium</i> blown down by the wind
in 1219 must have been the wooden stockade on the
west side of the outer bailey.<a name="FNanchor_377" id="FNanchor_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> The question is difficult
to decide, but at any rate the entry proves that as late
as Henry III.&rsquo;s reign, some part of the outer defences
of Colchester Castle was still of timber.</p>

<p>The position of Colchester Castle is exceptional in
one respect, that the castle is almost in the middle of
the town. But this very unusual position is explained
by Mr Round&rsquo;s statement that the land forming the
castle baileys, as well as that afterwards given to the
Grey Friars on the east, was crown demesne before the
Conquest, and consequently had been cultivated land, so
that we do not hear of any houses in Colchester being
destroyed for the site of the castle.<a name="FNanchor_378" id="FNanchor_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> But by keeping
this land as the inalienable appendage of the royal castle
William secured that communication between the castle
and the outside country which was so essential to the
invaders.</p>

<p>The value of the city of Colchester had risen enormously
at the date of the Survey.<a name="FNanchor_379" id="FNanchor_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corfe</span>, Dorset (<a href="#Fig_13">Fig. 13</a>).&mdash;Mr Eyton has shown that
for the <i>castellum Warham</i> of Domesday Book we ought
to read <i>Corfe</i>, because the castle was built in the manor
of Kingston, four miles from Wareham.<a name="FNanchor_380" id="FNanchor_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> And this is
made clear by the <i>Testa de Nevill</i>, which says that the
church of Gillingham was given to the nunnery of
Shaftesbury in exchange for the land on which the
castle of Corfe is placed.<a name="FNanchor_381" id="FNanchor_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> Because King Edward the
Martyr was murdered at Corfe, at some place where his
stepmother Elfrida was residing, it has been inferred
that there was a Saxon castle at Corfe; and because
there is a building with some herring-bone work among
the present ruins, it has been assumed that this building
is the remains of that castle or palace. But the <i>Anglo-Saxon
Chronicle</i>, the only contemporary authority for
the event, says nothing of any castle at Corfe, but simply
tells us that Edward was slain at Corfe Geat, a name
which evidently alludes to a gap or passage through the
chalk hills, such as there is at Corfe.<a name="FNanchor_382" id="FNanchor_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> Nor is there any
mention of Corfe as a fortress in Anglo-Saxon times;
it is not named in the <i>Burghal Hidage</i>, and we do not
hear of any sieges of it by the Danes. Nor is it likely
that the Saxons would have had a fortress at Corfe,
when they had a fortified town so near as Wareham.<a name="FNanchor_383" id="FNanchor_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
Kingston, the manor in which Corfe is situated, was not
an important place, as it had no dependent soke. The
language of Domesday absolutely upsets the idea of any
Saxon castle or palace at Corfe, as it tells us that
William obtained the land for his castle from the nuns
of Shaftesbury, and we may be quite sure they had no
castle there.<a name="FNanchor_384" id="FNanchor_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a></p>

<p>Corfe Castle stands on a natural hill, which has been
so scarped artificially that the highest part now forms a
large motte. Three wards exist&mdash;the eastern or motte
ward, the western, and the southern. The two former
probably formed the original castle. On the motte
(which possibly is not artificial, but formed by scarping)
stands the lofty keep, of splendid workmanship,
probably of the time of Henry I. In the ward
pertaining to it are buildings of the time of John and
Henry III.<a name="FNanchor_385" id="FNanchor_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> The western ward has towers of the 13th
century, but it also contains the interesting remains of
an early Norman building, probably a hall or chapel,
built largely of herring-bone work; this is the building
which has been so positively asserted to be a Saxon
palace. But herring-bone masonry, which used to be
thought an infallible sign of Saxon work, is now found
to be more often Norman.<a name="FNanchor_386" id="FNanchor_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> The building is certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
an ancient one, and may possibly have been contemporary
with the first Norman castle; its details are
unmistakably Norman. But very likely it was the only
Norman masonry of the 11th century at Corfe Castle.<a name="FNanchor_387" id="FNanchor_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a>
It is clear that the stone wall which at present surrounds
the western bailey did not exist when the hall (or
chapel) was built, as it blocks up its southern windows.
Probably there was a palisade at first on the edge of
the scarp. Palisades still formed part of the defences of
the castle in the time of Henry III., when 62<i>l.</i> was
paid &ldquo;for making two good walls in place of the
palisades at Corfe between the old bailey of the said
castle and the middle bailey towards the west, and
between the keep of the said castle and the outer bailey
towards the south.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_388" id="FNanchor_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> This shows that the present
wing-walls down from the motte were previously represented
by stockades. The ditch between the keep and
the southern bailey has been attributed to King John,
on the strength of an entry in the <i>Close Rolls</i> which
orders fifteen miners and stone-masons to work on the
banks of the ditch in 1214.<a name="FNanchor_389" id="FNanchor_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> But we may be quite
certain that this ditch below the motte belonged to the
original plan of the castle; John&rsquo;s work would be either
to line it with masonry, or to enlarge it. It is not
without significance for the early history of the castle
that Durandus the <i>carpenter</i> held the manor of
Mouldham near Corfe, by the service of finding a
carpenter to work at the keep whenever required.<a name="FNanchor_390" id="FNanchor_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a></p>

<p>The area of Corfe Castle, if we include the large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
southern bailey, is 3&frac34; acres; without it, 1&frac12; acres. This
bailey was certainly in existence in the reign of Henry
III. (as the extract from the <i>Close Rolls</i> proves) before
the towers of superb masonry were added to it by
Edward I.</p>

<p>The value of Kingston Manor had considerably
increased at the date of the Survey. After the Count
of Mortain forfeited his lands (in 1105), the castle of
Corfe was kept in the hands of the crown, and this
increases the probability that the keep was built by
Henry I.</p>

<p>About 400 yards S.W. of Corfe Castle is an
earthwork which might be called a &ldquo;Ring and Bailey.&rdquo;
Instead of the usual motte there is a circular enclosure,
defended by a bank and ditch of about the same height
as those of its bailey, but having in addition an interior
platform or berm. This work is probably the remains
of a camp thrown up by Stephen during his unsuccessful
siege of Corfe Castle in 1139.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dover</span>, Kent (<a href="#Fig_14">Fig. 14</a>).&mdash;The Norman historian,
William of Poitiers, tells us that the castrum of Dover
was built by Harold at his own expense.<a name="FNanchor_391" id="FNanchor_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> This comes
from the celebrated story of the oath of Harold to
William, a story of which Mr Freeman says that there
is no portion of our history more entangled in the mazes
of contradictory and often impossible statements.<a name="FNanchor_392" id="FNanchor_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> But
let us assume the statement about the <i>castrum</i> to be
true; the question then to be answered is this: of what
nature was that castrum? We never are told by
English chroniclers that Harold built any castles,
though we do hear of his fortifying towns. The present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
writer would answer this question, tentatively indeed,
and under correction, by the theory that the castrum
constructed or repaired by Harold was the present outer
rampart of Dover Castle, which encloses an area of
about 34 acres, and may have enclosed more, if it was
formerly complete on the side towards the sea.<a name="FNanchor_393" id="FNanchor_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> The
evidence in support of this theory is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. There certainly was a <i>burh</i> on the top of the cliff
at Dover in Saxon times, as the <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i>
tells us that in 1048 Eustace of Boulogne, after coming
to Dover, and slaying householders there, went <i>up to
the burh</i>, and slew people both within and without, but
was repulsed by the burh-men.<a name="FNanchor_394" id="FNanchor_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> There was then a
burh, and valiant burh-men on the cliff at Dover in
Edward the Confessor&rsquo;s reign. But the whole analogy
of the word burh makes it certain that by the time of
Edward it meant a fortified town.<a name="FNanchor_395" id="FNanchor_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a></p>

<p>2. That the burh at Dover was of the nature of a
town, with houses in it, is confirmed by the poem of Guy
of Amiens, who says that when King William entered
the <i>castrum</i>, he ordered the English to evacuate their
houses.<a name="FNanchor_396" id="FNanchor_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> William of Poitiers also states that there was an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
innumerable multitude of people in the castle,<a name="FNanchor_397" id="FNanchor_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> though
he may refer to a multitude gathered there for safety.</p>

<p>3. Though the whole of the outer enceinte is
generally credited to Hubert de Burgh in Henry III.&rsquo;s
reign, the truth probably is that he built the first stone
walls and towers on the outer rampart; but the existence
of this earthen rampart shows that there was a wooden
wall upon it previously. It is not improbable that it
was for the repair of this wooden wall that so much
timber was sent to Dover in the reigns of Richard I.
and John.<a name="FNanchor_398" id="FNanchor_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> Dering, who was lieutenant of the castle in
1629, records the tradition that the tower in the outer
enceinte, called Canons&rsquo; Gate, dates from Saxon times
(of course this could only be true of a wooden predecessor
of the stone tower), and that Godwin&rsquo;s Tower, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
the east side of the outer vallum, existed as a postern
before the Conquest.<a name="FNanchor_399" id="FNanchor_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> Nearly all the towers on this
wall were supported by certain manors held on the
tenure of castle-guard, and eight of them still retain the
names of eight knights to whom William is said to have
given lands on this tenure. Mr Round has shown that
the <i>Warda Constabularii</i> of Dover Castle can be traced
back to the Conquest, and that it is a mere legend that
it was given as a fief to a Fienes. He remarks that the
nine wards of the castle named in the Red Book of the
Exchequer are all reproduced in the names still attached
to the towers. &ldquo;This coincidence of testimony leads us
to believe that the names must have been attached at a
very early period; and looking at the history of the
families named, it cannot have been later than that of
Henry II.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_400" id="FNanchor_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> May it not have been even earlier?
Eight of these names are attached to towers on the
outer circuit,<a name="FNanchor_401" id="FNanchor_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> and five of them are found as landholders
in Kent in Domesday Book.</p>

<p>4. William of Poitiers further tells us that when the
duke had taken the castle, he remained there eight days,
<i>to add the fortifications which were wanting</i>.<a name="FNanchor_402" id="FNanchor_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> What
was wanting to a Norman eye in Anglo-Saxon fortifications,
as far as we know them, was a citadel; and
without laying too much stress on the chronicler&rsquo;s eight
days, we may assume that the short time spent by
William at Dover was just enough for the construction
of a motte and bailey, inside the <i>castrum</i> of Harold, but
crowned by wooden buildings only.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>Taking these things together, we venture to assume
that the inner court in which the keep of Dover stands,
represents an original motte, or at any rate an original
citadel, added to the castle by William I. Whether
what now remains of this motte is in part artificial, we
do not pretend to say; it may be that it was formed
simply by digging a deep ditch round the highest knoll
of ground within the ancient ramparts.<a name="FNanchor_403" id="FNanchor_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> Anyhow, it
is still in effect a motte, and a large one, containing not
only the magnificent keep, but a small ward as well.
That this keep was the work of Henry II. there can
be no manner of doubt; the <i>Pipe Rolls</i> show that he
spent more than £2000 on the <i>turris</i> or keep of Dover
Castle between the years 1181 and 1187, and Benedict
of Peterborough mentions the building of the keep at
this date.<a name="FNanchor_404" id="FNanchor_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> The curtain around the motte may also be
reckoned to be his work originally, as the <i>cingulum</i> is
spoken of along with the <i>turris</i> in the accounts.
Modern alterations have left little of Norman character
in this curtain which shows at a glance, and the gateways
(one of which remains) belong to a later period.</p>

<p>Attached to this keep ward is another ward, whose
rampart is generally attributed to Saxon times. We
are not in a position positively to deny that the Saxons
had an inner earthwork on the highest part of the
ground within their <i>burh</i>. But considering that small
citadels are unusual in Saxon earthworks: considering
also that this bailey is attached to the motte in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
usual manner of a Norman bailey, and that its size
corresponds to the usual size of an original Norman
bailey in an important place, it does not seem unreasonable
to suppose that this was the original bailey attached
to the Conqueror&rsquo;s motte. Its shape is singular, part
of it being nearly square, while at the S.E. corner a
large oval loop is thrown out, so as to enclose the
Roman Pharos and the Saxon church. The outline of
the bailey certainly suggests that it was built after the
Pharos and the church, and was built with reference
primarily to the keep or motte ward. The nature of
the ground, and the necessity of enclosing the church
and the Roman tower within the immediate bailey of
the castle, which would otherwise have been commanded
by them, were the other factors which decided the
unusual shape of the bailey.</p>

<p>On this earthwork the foundations of a rubble wall
were formerly to be traced,<a name="FNanchor_405" id="FNanchor_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> probably built by Henry
II., as considerable sums for &ldquo;the wall of the castle&rdquo;
are mentioned in his accounts.<a name="FNanchor_406" id="FNanchor_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> Whether there are still
any remains of this curtain we are unable to say, but so
many of the features of the middle ward have been
swept away by modern alterations, and the difficulty of
examining what remains, owing to military restrictions,
is so great, that little can be said about it, and we find
that most authorities observe a judicious silence on the
subject. But as the carriage of stone is expressly
mentioned in Henry II.&rsquo;s accounts, we may with great
probability assign to him the transformation of the
original wooden castle of William into a castle of stone;
while the transformation of the Anglo-Saxon borough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
into a stone enceinte was the work of Henry III.&rsquo;s
reign.</p>

<p>We think the evidence suggests that this <i>burh</i> or
outer rampart was in existence when the Conqueror
came to Dover, crowned in all probability with a
stockade and towers of wood. It may possibly have
been a British or even a Roman earthwork originally
(though its outline does not suggest Roman work); or
it may have been built by Harold as a city of refuge
for the inhabitants of the port.<a name="FNanchor_407" id="FNanchor_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> The Saxon church
which it encloses, and which has long been attributed
to the earliest days of Saxon Christianity, is now
pronounced by the best authorities to be comparatively
late in the style.<a name="FNanchor_408" id="FNanchor_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a></p>

<p>The size of the inner castle of Dover appears to be
about 6 acres, reckoning the keep ward at 2, and
the bailey at about 4.</p>

<p>The value of the town of Dover had trebled at the
time of the Survey, in spite of the burning of the town
at William&rsquo;s first advent.<a name="FNanchor_409" id="FNanchor_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a></p>

&ldquo;a great English residence.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_411" id="FNanchor_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> This tradition, however,
is not supported by Domesday Book, which shows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
Dudley to have been only a small and unimportant
manor before the Conquest. The strong position of the
hill was no doubt the reason why the Norman placed
his castle there. There is no Norman masonry in the
present ruins. The earliest work is that of the keep
on the motte, a rectangular tower with round corner
turrets, attributed by Mr W. St John Hope to about
1320. The first castle was demolished by Henry II. in
1175,<a name="FNanchor_412" id="FNanchor_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> and an attempt to restore it in 1218 was stringently
countermanded.<a name="FNanchor_413" id="FNanchor_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> The case of Dudley is one of
those which proves that Henry II. destroyed some
lawful castles in 1175 as well as the unlawful ones. In
1264 a license to restore it was granted to Roger de
Somery, in consideration of his devotion to the king&rsquo;s
cause in the Barons&rsquo; War.<a name="FNanchor_414" id="FNanchor_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> The whole area of the
castle, including the motte, but not including the works
at the base of the hill on which it stands, is 1&frac34; acres.
The bailey is an irregular oval, following the hill top.
Dudley is an instance in which the value of the manor
has gone down instead of up since the erection of the
castle; this may perhaps be laid to the account of the
devastation caused through the Staffordshire insurrection
of 1069.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunster</span>, Somerset (<a href="#Fig_15">Fig. 15</a>).&mdash;Called Torre in
Domesday Book. &ldquo;There William de Moion has his
castle.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_415" id="FNanchor_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> The motte here appears to be a natural rock
or <i>tor</i>, whose summit has been levelled and its sides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
scarped by art. About 80 feet below the top is a
(roughly) half-moon bailey, itself a shelf on the side
of the hill; there is another and much smaller shelf
at the opposite end.<a name="FNanchor_416" id="FNanchor_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> Some foundations found in the
S.W. corner of the upper ward appear to indicate a
former stone keep.<a name="FNanchor_417" id="FNanchor_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> Dunster was only a small manor of
half a hide before the Conquest, but afterwards its value
tripled. There was a borough as well as a castle.<a name="FNanchor_418" id="FNanchor_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a>
The castle became the <i>caput baroniæ</i> of the De Moions,
to whom the Conqueror gave fifty-six manors in
different parts of the county. There is not the slightest
reason to suppose that the site was fortified before the
Conquest. Mr Clark remarks that &ldquo;it is remarkable
that no mouldings or fragments of Norman ornament
have been dug up in or about the site, although there is
original Norman work in the parish church.&rdquo; The
simple explanation, probably, is that the first castle of
De Moion was of wood, although on a site where it
would have been possible to build in stone from the
first, as it does not appear that any part of the motte is
artificial. The area of the bailey is 1&frac34; acres. The
value of Dunster had risen at the date of Domesday.<a name="FNanchor_419" id="FNanchor_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Durham</span> (<a href="#Fig_16">Fig. 16</a>).&mdash;The castle here was first
built by the Conqueror, on his return from his expedition
against Scotland in 1072.<a name="FNanchor_420" id="FNanchor_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> It was intended as a
strong residence for the bishop, through whom William<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
hoped to govern this turbulent part of the country.
He placed it on the neck of the lofty peninsula on which
the cathedral stands. The motte of the Conqueror still
remains, and so does the chapel<a name="FNanchor_421" id="FNanchor_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> which he built in the
bailey; probably the present court of the castle, though
crowded now with buildings, represents the outline of
the original bailey.<a name="FNanchor_422" id="FNanchor_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> The present shell keep on the
motte was built by Bishop Hatfield in Edward III.&rsquo;s
reign,<a name="FNanchor_423" id="FNanchor_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> but has been extensively modernised. There
can be little doubt that up to 1345 there were only
wooden buildings on the motte, as the writer was
informed by Canon Greenwell that no remains of older
stone-work than the 14th century had been found there.
It is so seldom that we get any contemporary description
of a castle of this kind, that it seems worth while
to translate the bombastic verse in which Laurence,
Prior of Durham, described that of Durham in
Stephen&rsquo;s reign:<a name="FNanchor_424" id="FNanchor_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;Not far hence [from the north road into the city]
a tumulus of rising earth explains the flatness of the
excavated summit, explains the narrow field on the
flattened vertex, which the apex of the castle occupies
with very pleasing art. On this open space the castle
is seated like a queen; from its threatening height, it
holds all that it sees as its own. From its gate, the
stubborn wall rises with the rising mound,<a name="FNanchor_425" id="FNanchor_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> and rising
still further, makes towards the comfort (amæna) of the
keep. But the keep, compacted together, rises again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
into thin air, strong within and without, well fitted for
its work, for within the ground rises higher by three
cubits than without&mdash;ground made sound by solid earth.
Above this, a stalwart house<a name="FNanchor_426" id="FNanchor_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> springs yet higher than
the [shell] keep, glittering with splendid beauty in
every part; <i>four posts are plain, on which it rests, one
post at each strong corner</i>.<a name="FNanchor_427" id="FNanchor_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> Each face is girded by a
beautiful gallery, which is fixed into the warlike wall.<a name="FNanchor_428" id="FNanchor_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a>
A bridge, rising from the chapel [in the bailey] gives
a ready ascent to the ramparts, easy to climb; starting
from them, a broad way makes the round of the top of
the wall, and this is the usual way to the top of the
citadel.... The bridge is divided into easy steps, no
headlong drop, but an easy slope from the top to the
bottom. Near the [head of the] bridge, a wall descends
from the citadel, turning its face westward towards the
river.<a name="FNanchor_429" id="FNanchor_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> From the river&rsquo;s lofty bank it turns away in a
broad curve to meet the field [<i>i.e.</i>, Palace Green]. It
is no bare plot empty of buildings that this high wall
surrounds with its sweep, but one containing goodly
habitations.<a name="FNanchor_430" id="FNanchor_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> There you will find two vast palaces built
with porches, the skill of whose builders the building<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
well reveals. There, too, the chapel stands out beautifully
raised on six pillars, not over vast, but fair enough
to view. Here chambers are joined to chambers, house
to house, each suited to the purpose that it serves....
There is a building in the middle of the castle which
has a deep well of abundant water.... The frowning
gate faces the rainy south, a gate that is strong, high-reaching,
easily held by the hand of a weakling or a
woman. The bridge is let down for egress,<a name="FNanchor_431" id="FNanchor_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> and thus
the way goes across the broad moat. It goes to the
plain which is protected on all sides by a wall, where the
youth often held their joyous games. Thus the
castellan, and the castle artfully placed on the high
ridge, defend the northern side of the cathedral. And
from this castle a strong wall goes down southwards,
continued to the end of the church.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_432" id="FNanchor_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a></p>

<p>The original bailey of this castle covers 1 acre.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ely</span>, Cambridgeshire (<a href="#Fig_17">Fig. 17</a>).&mdash;This castle was
built by William I. in 1070, when he was repressing the
last struggle of the English under the heroic Hereward.
The monks of Ely felt it a sore grievance that he placed
the castle within their own bounds.<a name="FNanchor_433" id="FNanchor_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> Both this castle
and the one built by William at Aldreth, to defend the
passage into the Isle of Ely, had a continuous existence,
as they were both refortified by Nigel, Bishop of Ely in
Stephen&rsquo;s reign, and Ely Castle was besieged and taken
by Stephen.<a name="FNanchor_434" id="FNanchor_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> The earthworks of this castle still exist,
to the south of the Minster. There is a fine motte with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
an oval bailey, of which the banks and ditches are
traceable in parts. The area of the bailey is 2&frac12; acres.
Of Aldreth or Aldrey there appear to be no remains.</p>

<p>The value of the manor of Ely was £33 in the
Confessor&rsquo;s reign; it fell to £20 after the devastations
of the Conquest, but had risen again to £30 at the time
of the Survey.<a name="FNanchor_435" id="FNanchor_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ewias</span>, Herefordshire (<a href="#Fig_17">Fig. 17</a>).&mdash;The brief notice of
this castle in Domesday Book throws some light on the
general theory of castle-building in England.<a name="FNanchor_436" id="FNanchor_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> William
FitzOsbern, as the king&rsquo;s vicegerent, rebuilt this march
castle, and committed it to the keeping of another
Norman noble, and the king confirmed the arrangement.
But in theory the castle would always be the king&rsquo;s.
This is the only case in the Survey where we hear of a
castle being <i>rebuilt</i> by the Normans. We naturally look
to one of King Edward&rsquo;s Norman favourites as the first
founder, for they alone are said by history to have built
castles on the Welsh marches before the Conquest.
Dr Round conjectures that Ewias was the &ldquo;Pentecost&rsquo;s
castle&rdquo; spoken of in the (Peterborough) <i>Anglo-Saxon
Chronicle</i> in 1052.<a name="FNanchor_437" id="FNanchor_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> No masonry is now to be seen
on the motte at Ewias, but Mr Clark states that the
outline of a circular or polygonal shell keep is shown by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
a trench out of which the foundations have been removed.
The bailey is roughly of half-moon shape and the mound
oval. The whole area of the castle, including the motte
and banks, is 2-&#8531; acres.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Exeter</span>.&mdash;This castle is not mentioned in Domesday
Book, but Ordericus tells us that William <i>chose</i> a
site for the castle within the walls, and left Baldwin
de Molis, son of Count Gilbert, and other distinguished
knights, to finish the work, and remain as
a garrison.<a name="FNanchor_438" id="FNanchor_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> In spite of this clear indication that the
castle was a new thing, it has been obstinately held that
it only occupied the site of some former castle, Roman
or Saxon.<a name="FNanchor_439" id="FNanchor_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> Exeter, of course, was a Roman castrum,
and its walls had been restored by Athelstan. In this
case William placed his castle inside instead of outside
the city walls, because, owing to the natural situation of
Exeter, he found in the north-west corner a site which
commanded the whole city. Although Domesday Book
is silent about the castle, it tells us that forty-eight
houses in Exeter had been destroyed since William
came to England,<a name="FNanchor_440" id="FNanchor_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> and Freeman remarks that &ldquo;we may
assume that these houses were destroyed to make room
for the castle, though it is not expressly said that they
were.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_441" id="FNanchor_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a></p>

<p>Exeter Castle stands on a natural knoll, occupying
the north-west corner of the city, which has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
converted into a sort of square motte by digging a great
ditch round the two sides of its base towards the town.<a name="FNanchor_442" id="FNanchor_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a>
That this ditch is no pre-Roman work is shown by the
fact that it stops short at the Roman wall, and begins
again on the outside of it, where, however, the greater
part has been levelled to form the promenade of the
<i>Northernhay</i> or north rampart of the city. On top of
this hill, banks 30 feet high were thrown up, which still
remain, and give to the courtyard which they enclose
the appearance of a pit.<a name="FNanchor_443" id="FNanchor_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> On top of these banks there
are now stone walls; but these were certainly no part
of the work of Baldwin de Molis, who must have placed
a wooden stockade on the banks which he constructed.
One piece of stonework he probably did set up, the
gatehouse, which by its triangle-headed windows and
its long-and-short work is almost certainly of the 11th
century. It has frequently been called Saxon, but
more careful critics now regard it as &ldquo;work that must
have been done, if not by Norman hands, at Norman
bidding and on Norman design.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_444" id="FNanchor_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> It was no uncommon
thing at this early period to have gatehouses of stone
to walls of earth and wood. Of these gatehouses
Exeter is the most perfect and the most clearly stamped
with antiquity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>One thing we look for in vain at Exeter, and that is
a citadel. There is no keep, and there is no record that
there ever was one, though a chapel, hall, and other
houses are mentioned in ancient accounts. Mr Clark
says that probably the Normans regarded the whole
court as a shell keep. It certainly was, in effect, a
motte; but it was altogether exceptional among Norman
castles of importance if it had no bailey. And in fact a
bailey is mentioned in the <i>Pipe Roll</i> of 1 Richard I.,
where there is an entry for the cost of making a gaol in
the bailey of the castle.<a name="FNanchor_445" id="FNanchor_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> Now Norden, who published
a plan of Exeter in 1619, says that the prison which
formerly existed at the bottom of Castle Lane (on the
south or city front of the present castle) was &ldquo;built upon
Castle grounde,&rdquo; and he states that the buildings and
gardens which have been made on this ground are
intrusions on the king&rsquo;s rights.<a name="FNanchor_446" id="FNanchor_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> The remarkably full
account of the siege of Exeter in the <i>Gesta Stephani</i>
speaks of an outer <i>promurale</i> which was taken by
Stephen, as well as the inner bridge leading from the
town to the castle, before the attack on the castle itself.
Unfortunately the word <i>promurale</i> has the same uncertainty
about it that attaches to so many mediæval
terms, and the description given of it would apply
either to the banks of a bailey, or to the <i>heriçon</i>
on the counterscarp of the ditch of the motte. We
must, therefore, leave it to the reader&rsquo;s judgment
whether the evidence given above is sufficient to
establish the former existence of a bailey at Exeter,
and to place Exeter among the castles of the motte-and-bailey
type.</p>

<p>The description of the castle given by the writer of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
the Gesta has many points of interest.<a name="FNanchor_447" id="FNanchor_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> He describes
the castle as standing on a very high mound (<i>editissimo
aggere</i>) hedged in by an insurmountable wall, which
was defended by &ldquo;Cæsarian&rdquo; towers built with the very
hardest mortar. This must refer to Roman towers
which may have existed on the Roman part of the wall.
Whether there was a stone wall on the other two sides,
facing the city, may be doubted, as the expenditure
entered to Henry II. in the <i>Pipe Rolls</i> suggests that he
was the first to put stone walls on the banks, and the
two ancient towers which still exist appear to be of his
time.<a name="FNanchor_448" id="FNanchor_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> The chronicler goes on to say that after Stephen
had taken the <i>promurale</i> and broken down the bridge,
there were several days and nights of fighting before he
could win the castle, which was eventually forced to
surrender by the drying-up of the wells. The mining
operations which he describes were no doubt undertaken
with the view of shaking down the Roman wall at the
angle where it joins the artificial bank of Baldwin de
Molis. Possibly the chamber in the rock with the
mysterious passages leading from it, which is still to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
seen in the garden of Miss Owthwaite, at the point
where the ditch ends, is the work of Stephen&rsquo;s miners.<a name="FNanchor_449" id="FNanchor_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a>
The description of his soldiers scrambling up the <i>agger</i>
on their hands and knees (<i>quadrupede incessu</i>) will be
well understood by those who have seen the castle bank
as it still rises from that ditch.</p>

<p>The present ward of Exeter Castle, which is rudely
square in plan, covers an area of 2 acres, which is as
large as the whole area of many of the smaller Norman
castles. The castle was allowed to fall into decay as
early as 1549,<a name="FNanchor_450" id="FNanchor_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> and since then it has been devastated by
the building of a Sessions House and a gaol. No plan
has been preserved of the former buildings in this court,
though the site of the chapel is known.</p>

<p>There is no statement in Domesday Book as to the
value of Exeter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eye</span>, Suffolk (<a href="#Fig_17">Fig. 17</a>).&mdash;This castle was built by
William Malet, one of the companions of the Conqueror,
who is described as having been half Norman and half
English.<a name="FNanchor_451" id="FNanchor_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> Eye, as its name implies, seems to have
been an island in a marsh in Norman times, and therefore
a naturally defensible situation. The references in
the <i>Pipe Rolls</i> to the <i>palicium</i> and the <i>bretasches</i> of Eye
Castle show that the outer defences of the castle at any
rate were of wood in the days of Henry II.<a name="FNanchor_452" id="FNanchor_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
there were works in masonry at some subsequent period
is shown by a solitary vestige of a wing wall of flints
which runs up the motte. A modern tower now
occupies the summit. The bailey of the castle, the
outline of which can still be traced, though the area is
covered with buildings and gardens, was oval in shape,
and covered 2 acres.</p>

<p>The value of the manor of Eye had gone up since the
Conquest from £15 to £21. This must have been due to
the castle and to the market which Robert Malet or his
son William established close to the castle; for the stock
on the manor and the number of ploughs had actually
decreased.<a name="FNanchor_453" id="FNanchor_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> A proof that there is no deliberate register
of castles in Domesday Book is furnished by the very
careful inventory of the manor of Eye, where there is no
mention of a castle, though it is noticed that there are
now a park and a market; and it is only in the account
of the lands of the bishop of Thetford, in mentioning
the injury which William Malet&rsquo;s market at Eye had
done to the bishop&rsquo;s market at Hoxne, that the castle of
Eye is named.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gloucester.</span>&mdash;&ldquo;There were sixteen houses where
the castle sits, but now they are gone, and fourteen have
been destroyed in the <i>burgus</i> of the city,&rdquo; says Domesday
Book.<a name="FNanchor_454" id="FNanchor_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> Gloucester was undoubtedly a Roman
<i>chester</i>, and Roman pavements have been found there.<a name="FNanchor_455" id="FNanchor_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a>
The description in the Survey would lead us to think
that the castle was outside the ancient walls,<a name="FNanchor_456" id="FNanchor_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
Speed&rsquo;s map places it on the line of the wall of his time,
which may have been a mediæval extension. The castle
of Gloucester is now entirely destroyed, but there is
sufficient evidence to show that it was of the usual
Norman type. There was a motte, which was standing
in 1819, and which was then called the Barbican Hill;<a name="FNanchor_457" id="FNanchor_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a>
it appears to have been utilised as part of the works of
the barbican. This motte must originally have
supported a wooden keep, and Henry I. must have been
the builder of the stone keep which Leland saw &ldquo;in the
middle of the area;&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_458" id="FNanchor_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> for in 1100 Henry gave lands to
Gloucester Abbey &ldquo;in exchange for the site where now
the keep of Gloucester stands.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_459" id="FNanchor_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> The bailey had
previously been enlarged by William Rufus.<a name="FNanchor_460" id="FNanchor_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> Possibly
the <i>framea turris</i> or framework tower spoken of in
Henry II.&rsquo;s reign may refer to the wooden keep which
had been left standing on the motte.<a name="FNanchor_461" id="FNanchor_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> The walls of
Gloucester Castle were frequently repaired by Henry II.,<a name="FNanchor_462" id="FNanchor_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a>
but the word <i>murus</i> by no means implies always a stone
wall, and it is certain that the castle was at that time
surrounded by a wooden stockade, as a writ of a much
later period (1225) says that the stockade which is
around our castle of Gloucester has been blown down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
and broken by the wind, and must be repaired.<a name="FNanchor_463" id="FNanchor_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a>
Wooden bretasches on the walls are spoken of in the
<i>Pipe Rolls</i> of 1193, and even as late as 1222.<a name="FNanchor_464" id="FNanchor_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a></p>

<p>The value of the city of Gloucester had apparently
risen at the time of the Survey, though the entry being
largely in kind, T. R. E., it is not easy to calculate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hastings</span>, Sussex (<a href="#Fig_18">Fig. 18</a>).&mdash;In this case we have
positive contemporary evidence that the earthen mound
of the castle was thrown up by the Normans at the time
of the Conquest, for there is a picture in the Bayeux
Tapestry which shows them doing it. A number of
men with spades are at work raising a circular mound,
on the top of which, with the usual all-inclusiveness of
mediæval picturing, a stockade is already erected. A
man with a pick seems to be working at the ditch. The
inscription attached is: &ldquo;He commands that a castle
be dug at Hestengaceastra.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_465" id="FNanchor_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> There is no need to
comment on the significance of this drawing and its
inscription for the history of early Norman castles;
what is extraordinary is that it should have been entirely
overlooked for so long. In no case is our information
more complete than about Hastings. Not only does
Domesday Book mention the <i>castellaria</i> of Hastings,<a name="FNanchor_466" id="FNanchor_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a>
but the <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i> also tells us that
William built a castle there, while the chronicle of Battle
Abbey makes the evidence complete by telling us that
&ldquo;having taken possession of a suitable site, he built
a <i>wooden castle</i> there.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_467" id="FNanchor_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> This of course means the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
stockade on top of the motte, with the wooden tower or
towers which would certainly be added to it. Wace
states that this wooden castle was brought over in
pieces in the ships of the Count of Eu.<a name="FNanchor_468" id="FNanchor_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a></p>

<p>The masonry now existing at the castle is probably
none of it older than the reign of Henry II. at the
earliest, and most of it is certainly much later.<a name="FNanchor_469" id="FNanchor_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> The
<i>Pipe Rolls</i> show that Henry II. spent £235 on the
castle of Hastings between the years 1160 and 1181, and
it is indicated that some of this money was for stone,
and some was for a keep (<i>turrim</i>).<a name="FNanchor_470" id="FNanchor_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> There is no tower
large enough for a keep at Hastings now, nor have any
stone foundations been found on the motte, and Mr
Harold Sands, who has paid particular attention to this
castle, concludes that Henry II.&rsquo;s keep has been carried
away by the sea, which has probably torn away at least
2 acres from the area of the castle.<a name="FNanchor_471" id="FNanchor_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> The beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
fragment of the Chapel of St Mary is probably of
Henry II.&rsquo;s reign; the walls and towers on the
east side of the castle appear to be of the 13th century.
The ditch does not run round the motte, but is
cut through the peninsular rock on which the castle
stands, the motte and its ward being thus isolated.
The form of this bailey is now triangular, but it
may have been square originally. Beyond the ditch
is another bailey, defended by earthen banks and by
a second ditch cut through the peninsula.<a name="FNanchor_472" id="FNanchor_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> No exact
estimate can be given of the original area of the
castle, as so much of the cliff has been carried away
by the sea.</p>

<p>Hastings itself had been a fortified town before the
Norman Conquest, and is one of those mentioned in the
<i>Burghal Hidage</i>. The name Hæstingaceaster, given to
it in the <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i> (1050), is a proof that
the Saxons used the name <i>chester</i> for constructions of
their own, as no Roman remains have been found at
Hastings. But the Norman castle is outside the town,
on a cliff which overlooks it. As in the case of the other
ports of Sussex, the castle was committed to an
important noble, in this case the Count of Eu.</p>

<p>The manor of Bexley, in which Hastings Castle
stood, had been laid waste at the Conquest; at the date
of the Survey it was again rising in value, though it had
not reached the figure of King Edward&rsquo;s days.<a name="FNanchor_473" id="FNanchor_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hereford.</span>&mdash;There can be little doubt that the castle
of Hereford was built by the Norman Ralph, Earl of
Hereford, Edward the Confessor&rsquo;s nephew, about the
year 1048.<a name="FNanchor_474" id="FNanchor_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> It was burnt by the Welsh in 1055, after
which Harold fortified the town with a dyke and ditch;
but as Mr Freeman remarks, it is not said that he
restored the castle.<a name="FNanchor_475" id="FNanchor_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a> The motte of Earl Ralph is now
completely levelled, but it is mentioned several times in
documents of the 12th century,<a name="FNanchor_476" id="FNanchor_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> and is described in a
survey of 1652, from which it appears that it had a stone
keep tower, as well as a stone breastwork enclosing a
small ward.<a name="FNanchor_477" id="FNanchor_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> It stood outside the N.W. corner of
the bailey, surrounded by its own ditch; the site is still
called Castle Hill. If the castle was not restored before
the Norman Conquest it was certainly restored afterwards,
as in 1067 we find the &ldquo;men of the castle&rdquo;
fighting with Edric Child and the Welsh. The castle
appears to have had stone walls by the time of Henry II.,
as the mention of a kiln for their repair proves.<a name="FNanchor_478" id="FNanchor_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> But
these walls had wooden towers.<a name="FNanchor_479" id="FNanchor_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> The timber ordered in
1213 &ldquo;ad hordiandum castellum nostrum de Hereford&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_480" id="FNanchor_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
refers to the wooden <i>alures</i> or machicolations which
were placed on the tops of walls for the purpose of
defending the bases.</p>

<p>Though Hereford was a private castle in the
Confessor&rsquo;s reign, it was claimed for the crown by
Archbishop Hubert, the Justiciary, in 1197, and
continued to be a royal castle throughout the 13th
century.<a name="FNanchor_481" id="FNanchor_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a></p>

<p>The bailey of Hereford Castle still exists, with its fine
banks; it is kite-shaped and encloses 5&frac12; acres. The
castle stood within the city walls, in the south-east
angle.</p>

<p>The value of Hereford appears to have greatly
increased at the date of the Survey.<a name="FNanchor_482" id="FNanchor_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Huntingdon</span> (<a href="#Fig_18">Fig. 18</a>).&mdash;&ldquo;There were twenty houses
on the site of the castle, which are now gone.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_483" id="FNanchor_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a>
Ordericus tells us that the castle of Huntingdon was
built by William on his return from his second visit to
York in 1068.<a name="FNanchor_484" id="FNanchor_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> Huntingdon had been a walled town in
Anglo-Saxon times, and was very likely first fortified by
the Danes, but was repaired by Edward the Elder. As
in the case of so many other towns, the houses outside
the walls had to pay geld along with those of the city,
and it was some of the former which were displaced by
the new Norman castle. Huntingdon was part of the
patrimony of Earl Waltheof, and came to the Norman,
Simon de Senlis, through his marriage with Waltheof&rsquo;s
daughter and heiress. The line of Senlis ended in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
another heiress, who married David, afterwards the
famous king of Scotland; David thus became Earl of
Huntingdon. In the insurrection of the younger Henry
in 1174, William the Lion, grandson of David, took
sides with the young king, and consequently his castle
was besieged and taken by the forces of Henry II.,<a name="FNanchor_485" id="FNanchor_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> and
the king ordered it to be destroyed. The <i>Pipe Rolls</i>
show that this order was carried out, as they contain a
bill for &ldquo;hooks for pulling down the stockade of
Huntingdon Castle,&rdquo; and &ldquo;for the work of the new
castle at Huntingdon, and for hiring carpenters, and
crooks, and axes.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_486" id="FNanchor_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> We learn from these entries that
the original castle of the Conquest had just been replaced
by a new one, very likely a new fortification of the old
mounds by William, in anticipation of the insurrection.
We also learn that the new castle was a wooden one;
for a castle which has to be pulled down by carpenters
with hooks and axes is certainly not of stone. It does
not appear that the castle was ever restored, though
&ldquo;the chapel of the castle&rdquo; is spoken of as late as the
reign of Henry III.<a name="FNanchor_487" id="FNanchor_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a></p>

<p>The motte of Huntingdon still exists, and has not
the slightest sign of masonry. The bailey is roughly
square, with the usual rounded corners; the motte was
inside this enclosure, but had its own ditch. The whole
area was 2&frac12; acres, but another bailey was subsequently
added.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>The value of Huntingdon appears to have been
stationary at the time of the Survey, the loss of the
twenty houses causing a diminution of revenue which
must have been made up from the new feudal dues of
the castle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Launceston</span>, or Dunheved,<a name="FNanchor_488" id="FNanchor_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> Cornwall (<a href="#Fig_19">Fig. 19</a>).&mdash;There,
says Domesday Book, is the castle of the Earl
of Mortain.<a name="FNanchor_489" id="FNanchor_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> In another place it tells us that the earl
gave two manors to the bishop of Exeter &ldquo;for the
exchange of the castle of Cornwall,&rdquo; another name for
Dunheved Castle. We have already had occasion to
note that the &ldquo;exchange of the castle,&rdquo; in Domesday
language, is an abbreviation for the exchange of the site
of the castle. The fact that the land was obtained from
the church is a proof that the castle was new, for it was
not the custom of Saxon prelates thus to fortify themselves.
The motte of Launceston is a knoll of natural
rock, which has been scarped and heightened by art.
This motte now carries a circular keep, which cannot be
earlier than the 13th century.<a name="FNanchor_490" id="FNanchor_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> There is no early
Norman work whatever about the masonry of the castle,
and the remarkably elaborate fortifications on the motte
belong to a much later period.<a name="FNanchor_491" id="FNanchor_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> The motte rises in one
corner of a roughly rectangular bailey, which covers
3 acres. It stands outside the town walls, which still
exist, and join those of the castle, as at Totnes.
Launceston was only a small manor of ten ploughs in
the time of the Confessor. In spite of the building of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
the castle, the value of the manor had greatly gone down
in William&rsquo;s time.<a name="FNanchor_492" id="FNanchor_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> The ten ploughs had been reduced
to five.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 19.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Lewes</span>, Sussex (<a href="#Fig_19">Fig. 19</a>).&mdash;The castle of Lewes is
not mentioned in its proper place in Sussex by
Domesday Book, and this is another proof that the
Survey contains no inventory of castles; for that the
castle was existing at that date is rendered certain by
the numerous allusions in the Norfolk portion to &ldquo;the
exchange of the castle of Lewes.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_493" id="FNanchor_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> It is clear that at
some period, possibly during the revolt of Robert
Curthose in 1079, William I. gave large estates in
Norfolk to his trusty servant, William de Warenne, in
exchange for the important castle of Lewes, which he
may have preferred to keep in his own hands at that
critical period. This bargain cannot have held long, at
least as regards the castle, which continued to belong to
the Warenne family for many generations. We cannot
even guess now how the matter was settled, but the
lands in Norfolk certainly remained in the hands of the
Warennes.</p>

<p>Lewes is one of the very few castles in England
which have two mottes.<a name="FNanchor_494" id="FNanchor_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> They were placed at each end
of an oval bailey, each surrounded by its own ditch, and
each projecting about three-fourths beyond the line of
the bailey. On the northern motte only the foundations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
of a wall round the top remain; on the other, part of
the wall which enclosed a small ward, and two mural
towers. These towers have signs of the early Perpendicular
period, and are very likely of the reign of Edward
III., when the castle passed into the hands of the Fitz
Alans. The bailey, which enclosed an area of about
3 acres, is now covered with houses and gardens,
but parts of the curtain wall on the S.E. and E. stand
on banks, bearing witness to the original wooden fortifications.
The great interest of this bailey is its ancient
Norman gateway. The entrance was regarded by
mediæval architects as the weakest part of the fortress,
and we frequently find that it was the first part to
receive stone defences.<a name="FNanchor_495" id="FNanchor_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a> It is not surprising that at
such an important place as Lewes, which was then a
port leading to Normandy, and at the castle of so
powerful a noble, we should find an early case of stone
architecture supplementing the wooden defences. But
the two artificial mottes have no masonry that can be
called early Norman.</p>

<p>Lewes is one of the boroughs mentioned in the
<i>Burghal Hidage</i>, and was a <i>burgus</i> at the time of the
Survey.<a name="FNanchor_496" id="FNanchor_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> The value of the town had increased by
£1, 18s. from what it had been in King Edward&rsquo;s
time.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 20.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Lincoln</span> (<a href="#Fig_20">Fig. 20</a>).&mdash;Domesday Book tells us that
166 houses were destroyed to furnish the site of the
castle.<a name="FNanchor_497" id="FNanchor_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> The <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i> says that William
built a castle here on his return from his first visit to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
York in 1068, and Ordericus makes the same statement.<a name="FNanchor_498" id="FNanchor_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a>
Lincoln, like Exeter, was a Roman <i>castrum</i>, and the
Norman castle in both cases was placed in one corner
of the castrum; but the old Roman wall of Lincoln,
which stands on the natural ground, was not considered
to be a sufficient defence on the two exterior sides,
probably on account of its ruinous condition. It was
therefore buried in a very high and steep bank, which
was carried all round the new castle.<a name="FNanchor_499" id="FNanchor_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> This circumstance
seems to point to the haste with which the castle was
built, Lincoln being then for the first time subdued. The
fact that it was inside the probably closely packed Roman
walls explains why so many houses were destroyed for
the castle.<a name="FNanchor_500" id="FNanchor_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> Lincoln, like Lewes, has two mottes:
both are of about the same height, but the one in the
middle of the southern line of defence is the larger and
more important; it was originally surrounded with its
own ditch. It is now crowned with a polygonal shell
wall, which may have been built by the mother of
Ralph Gernon, Earl of Chester, in the reign of Henry I.<a name="FNanchor_501" id="FNanchor_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a>
The tower on the other motte, at the south-east corner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
has been largely rebuilt in the 14th century and added
to in modern times, but its lower storey still retains work
of Norman character. There is good reason to suppose
that this bailey was first walled with stone in Richard
I.&rsquo;s reign, as there is an entry in the <i>Pipe Rolls</i> of 1193-1194
&ldquo;for the cost of fortifying the bailey, £82, 16s. 4d.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_502" id="FNanchor_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a>
The present wall contains a good deal of herring-bone
work, and this circumstance led Mr Clark, who was
looking for something which he <i>could</i> put down to
William I.&rsquo;s time, to believe that the walls were of that
date. But the herring-bone work is all in patches, as
though for repairs, and herring-bone work was used
for repairs at all epochs of mediæval building. The
two gateways (that is the Norman portions of them) are
probably of about the same date as the castle wall. The
whole area is 5&frac34; acres.</p>

<p>The total revenue which the city of Lincoln paid
to the king and the earl had gone up from 30<i>l.</i> T. R. E.
to 100<i>l.</i> T. R. W. For the sake of those who imagine
that Saxon halls had anything to do with mottes, it is
worth noting that the hall which was the residence of
the chief landholder in Lincoln before the Conquest was
still in existence after the building of the castle, but
evidently had no connection with it.<a name="FNanchor_503" id="FNanchor_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a></p>

Monmouth.<a name="FNanchor_504" id="FNanchor_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a> Dr Round regards this as one of the
cases where <i>castellum</i> is to be interpreted as a town and
not as a castle. However this may be, the existence
of a Norman castle at Monmouth is rendered certain
by a passage in the <i>Book of Llandaff</i>, in which it is
said that this castle was built by William FitzOsbern,
and a short history of it is given, which brings it up to
the days of William Fitz Baderun.<a name="FNanchor_505" id="FNanchor_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a> Speed speaks of
this castle as &ldquo;standing mounted round in compasse,
and within her walls another mount, whereon a Towre
of great height and strength is built.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_506" id="FNanchor_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a> This sounds
like the description of a motte and bailey; but the motte
cannot be traced now. It is possible that it may have been
swept away to build the present barracks; the whole
castle is now on a flat-topped hill. The area is 1&frac34; acres.<a name="FNanchor_507" id="FNanchor_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a></p>

<p>The value of the manor before the Conquest is
not given.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Montacute</span>, Somerset (<a href="#Fig_21">Fig. 21</a>).&mdash;This is another
instance of a site for a castle obtained by exchange
from the church. Count Robert of Mortain gave the
manor of Candel to the priory of Athelney in exchange
for the manor of Bishopstowe, &ldquo;and there is his castle,
which is called Montagud.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_508" id="FNanchor_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> The English name for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
the village at the foot of the hill was Ludgarsburh,
which does not point to any fortification on the hill
itself, the spot where the wonder-working crucifix of
Waltham was found in Saxon times. Robert of
Mortain&rsquo;s son William gave the castle of Montacute,
with its chapel, orchard, and other appurtenances, to a
priory of Cluniac monks which he founded close to it.
The gift may have had something compulsory in it, for
William of Mortain was banished by Henry I. in 1104
as a partisan of Robert Curthose. Thus, as Leland
says, &ldquo;the notable castle partly fell to ruin, and partly was
taken down to make the priory, so that many years
since no building of it remained; only a chapel was set
upon the very top of the dungeon, and that yet standeth
there.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_509" id="FNanchor_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> There is still a high oval motte, having a
ditch between its base and the bailey; the latter is
semilunar in shape. The hill has been much terraced
on the eastern side, but this may have been the work
of the monks, for purposes of cultivation.<a name="FNanchor_510" id="FNanchor_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> There is no
masonry except a quite modern tower. According to
Mr Clark, the motte is of natural rock. The French
name of the castle was of course imported from
Normandy, and we generally find that an English
castle with a Norman-French name of this kind has a
motte.<a name="FNanchor_511" id="FNanchor_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a></p>

<p>Bishopstowe, in which the castle was placed, was
not a large manor in Saxon times. Its value T. R. E.
is not given in the Survey, but we are told that it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
worth 6<i>l.</i> to the earl, and 3<i>l.</i> 3<i>s.</i> to the knights who
hold under him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morpeth</span>, Northumberland (<a href="#Fig_21">Fig. 21</a>).&mdash;There is
only one mention known to us of Morpeth Castle in the
11th century, and that is in the poem of Geoffrey Gaimar.<a name="FNanchor_512" id="FNanchor_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a>
He says that William Rufus, when marching to
Bamborough, to repress the rebellion of Mowbray, Earl
of Northumberland, &ldquo;took the strong castle of Morpeth,
which was seated on a little mount,&rdquo; and belonged to
William de Morlei. Thus there can be no doubt that
the Ha&rsquo; Hill, about 100 yards to the N. of the present
castle, was the motte of the first castle of Morpeth,
though the remains of the motte, which are mentioned
by Hodgson, have been destroyed.<a name="FNanchor_513" id="FNanchor_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> A natural ridge
has been used to form a castle by cutting off its higher
end to form a motte, and making a court on the lower
part of the ridge. The great steepness of the slopes
rendered ordinary ditches unnecessary, nor are there
any traces now of banks or foundations. In the court
some Norman capitals and carved stones were found in
1830. This early castle was admirably placed for commanding
the river and the bridge.<a name="FNanchor_514" id="FNanchor_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> The present castle
of Morpeth was built in 1342-1349.<a name="FNanchor_515" id="FNanchor_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Newcastle</span>, Northumberland.&mdash;The first castle here
was built by Robert, son of William I., on his return
from his expedition to Scotland in 1080.<a name="FNanchor_516" id="FNanchor_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> It was of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
usual motte-and-bailey kind, the motte standing in a
small bailey which was rectilinear and roughly oblong.<a name="FNanchor_517" id="FNanchor_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a>
This motte was in existence when Brand wrote his
<i>History of Newcastle</i>, but was removed in 1811. The
castle was placed outside the Roman station at Monkchester,
and commanded a Roman bridge over the
Tyne, &ldquo;and to the north-east overlooked a ravine that
under the name of The Side formed for centuries a main
artery of communication between England and Scotland.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_518" id="FNanchor_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a>
Henry II., when he built the fine keep of this
castle, did not place it on the motte, but in the outer
and larger ward, which was roughly triangular. The
outer curtain appears to have stood on the banks of the
former earthen castle, as the Parliamentary Survey of
1649 speaks of the castle as &ldquo;bounded with strong works
of stone and mud.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_519" id="FNanchor_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> The area of the whole castle was
3 acres and 1 rood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Norham</span>, Northumberland (<a href="#Fig_22">Fig. 22</a>).&mdash;The first
castle here was built by Ranulf Flambard, Bishop of
Durham, in the reign of William Rufus. It was built
to defend Northumberland against the incursions of the
Scots, and we are expressly told that no castle had
existed there previously.<a name="FNanchor_520" id="FNanchor_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> This first castle, which we
may certainly assume to have been of earth and wood,
was destroyed by the Scots in 1138, and there does not
seem to have been any stone castle until the time of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
Bishop Puiset or Pudsey, who built the present keep by
command of King Henry II.<a name="FNanchor_521" id="FNanchor_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> Mr Clark tried hard to
find some work of Flambard&rsquo;s in this tower, but found
it difficult, and was driven back on the rather lame
assumption that &ldquo;the lapse of forty [really fifty at least]
years had not materially changed the style of architecture
then in use.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_522" id="FNanchor_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a> In fact, the Norman parts of
this keep show no work so early as the 11th century,
but are advanced in style, for not only was the basement
vaulted, but the first floor also. The simple explanation
is that Flambard threw up the large square motte on
which the keep now stands, and provided it with the
usual wooden defences. It also had a strong tower, but
almost certainly a wooden one; hence it was easily
destroyed by the Scots when once taken.<a name="FNanchor_523" id="FNanchor_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> The motte
was probably lowered to some extent when the stone
keep was built. It stands on a high bank overlooking
the Tweed, and is separated from its bailey by a deep
ditch. The bailey may be described as a segment of a
circle; its area is about 2 acres.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Norwich</span> (<a href="#Fig_23">Fig. 23</a>).&mdash;We find from Domesday
Book that no less than 113 houses were destroyed for
the site of this castle, a certain proof that the castle was
new.<a name="FNanchor_524" id="FNanchor_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> It is highly probable that it was outside the
primitive defences of the town, at any rate in part.
Norwich was built, partly on a peninsula formed by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
double bend of the river Wensum, partly in a district
lying south-west of this peninsula, and defended by a
ridge of rising ground running in a north-easterly
direction. The castle was placed on the edge of this
ridge, and all the oldest part of the town, including the
most ancient churches, lies to the east of it.<a name="FNanchor_525" id="FNanchor_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> In the
conjectural map of Norwich in 1100, given in Woodward&rsquo;s
<i>History of Norwich Castle</i>,<a name="FNanchor_526" id="FNanchor_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> the street called
Burg Street divides the Old Burg on the east from the
New Burg on the west; this street runs along a ridge
which traverses the neck of the peninsula from south-west
to north-east, and on the northern end of this
ridge the castle stands.<a name="FNanchor_527" id="FNanchor_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a> There can be little doubt that
this street marks the line of the <i>burh</i> or enclosing bank
by which the primitive town of Norwich was defended.<a name="FNanchor_528" id="FNanchor_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a>
A clear proof of this lies in the fact that the castle of
Norwich was anciently not in the jurisdiction of the
city, but in that of the county; the citizens had no
authority over the houses lying beyond the castle ditches
until it was expressly granted to them by Edward III.<a name="FNanchor_529" id="FNanchor_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a>
The mediæval walls of Norwich, vastly extending the
borders of the city, were not built till Henry III.&rsquo;s reign.<a name="FNanchor_530" id="FNanchor_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a></p>

<p>The motte of Norwich Castle, according to recent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
investigations, is entirely artificial;<a name="FNanchor_531" id="FNanchor_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a> it was originally

around it.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_532" id="FNanchor_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> The fancy of the antiquary Wilkins that
the motte was the centre of two concentric outworks<a name="FNanchor_533" id="FNanchor_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a>
was completely disproved by Mr Harrod, who showed
that the original castle was a motte with one of the
ordinary half-moon baileys attached. Another ward,
called the Castle Meadow, was probably added at a
later date. The magnificent keep which now stands
on the motte is undoubtedly a work of the 12th
century.<a name="FNanchor_534" id="FNanchor_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a> The castle which Emma, wife of Earl Ralf
Guader, defended against the Conqueror after the
celebrated bride-ale of Norwich was almost certainly a
wooden structure. As late as the year 1172 the bailey
was still defended by a wooden stockade and wooden
bretasches;<a name="FNanchor_535" id="FNanchor_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> and even in 1225 the stockade had not
been replaced by a stone wall.<a name="FNanchor_536" id="FNanchor_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a></p>

<p>Norwich was a royal castle, and consequently always
in the hands of the sheriff; it was never the property
of the Bigods.<a name="FNanchor_537" id="FNanchor_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a> As the fable that extensive lands
belonging to the monastery of Ely were held on the
tenure of castle guard at Norwich <i>before the Conquest</i>
is repeated by all the local historians,<a name="FNanchor_538" id="FNanchor_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> it is worth while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
to note that the charters of Henry I. setting the convent
free from this service, make no allusion to any such
ancient date for it,<a name="FNanchor_539" id="FNanchor_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a> and that the tenure of castle guard
is completely unknown to the Anglo-Saxon laws. The
area of the inner bailey is 3&frac14; acres, and that of the
outer, 4&frac12; acres. The value of Norwich had greatly
risen since the Conquest.<a name="FNanchor_540" id="FNanchor_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nottingham</span> (<a href="#Fig_22">Fig. 22</a>).&mdash;This important castle is
not mentioned in Domesday Book, but the <i>Anglo-Saxon
Chronicle</i> says that William I. built the castle at
Nottingham in 1067, on his way to repress the first
insurrection in Yorkshire. Ordericus, repeating this
statement, adds that he committed it to the keeping of
William Peverel.<a name="FNanchor_541" id="FNanchor_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a> The castle was placed on a lofty
headland at some distance from the Danish borough,
and between the two arose the Norman borough which
is mentioned in Domesday Book as the <i>novus burgus</i>.
The two upper wards of the present castle probably
represent William&rsquo;s plan. The upper ward forms a
natural motte of rock, as it is 15 feet higher than the
bailey attached to it, and has been separated from
it by a ditch cut across the rocky headland, which
can still be traced below the modern house which
now stands on the motte. Such a site was not
only treated as a motte, but was actually called by
that name, as we read of the <i>mota</i> of Nottingham
Castle in the <i>Pipe Rolls</i> of both John&rsquo;s and Richard I.&rsquo;s
reigns.</p>

<p>Mr Clark published a bird&rsquo;s-eye view of Nottingham
Castle in his <i>Mediæval Military Architecture</i>, about
which he only stated that it was taken from the
<i>Illustrated London News</i>. It does not agree with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
plan made by Simpson in 1617,<a name="FNanchor_542" id="FNanchor_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> and is therefore not
quite trustworthy; the position of the keep, for example,
is quite different. The keep, which Hutchison in his
Memoirs speaks of as &ldquo;the strong tower called the Old
Tower on the top of the rock,&rdquo; seems clearly Norman,
from the buttresses. It was placed (according to
Simpson&rsquo;s plan), on the north side of the small ward
which formed the top of the motte, and was enclosed in
a yet older shell wall which has now disappeared. The
height of this motte is indicated in the bird&rsquo;s-eye view
by the ascending wall which leads up it from the bailey.
It had its own ditch, as appears by several mentions in
the accounts of &ldquo;the drawbridge of the keep,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the
bridge leading up to the dongeon.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_543" id="FNanchor_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a> It is highly
probable that this keep was built by King John, as in
a <i>Mise Roll</i> of 1212 there is a payment entered
&ldquo;towards making the tower which the king commanded
to be built on the motte of Nottingham.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_544" id="FNanchor_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a> But the
first masonry in the castle was probably the work of
Henry II., who spent £1737, 9s. 5d. on the castle and
houses, the gaol, the king&rsquo;s chamber, the hall, and in
raising the walls and enclosing the bailey.<a name="FNanchor_545" id="FNanchor_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> The castle
has been so devastated by the 17th century spoiler, that
the work of Henry and John has been almost entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
swept away, but the one round tower which still remains
as part of the defences of the inner bailey, looks as
though it might be of the time of Henry II. This
bailey is semicircular; the whole original castle covers
only 1&#8532; acres. A very much larger bailey was added
afterwards, probably in John&rsquo;s reign.<a name="FNanchor_546" id="FNanchor_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a> Probably this
later bailey was at first enclosed with a bank and
stockade, and this stockade may be the palitium of
which there are notices in the records of Henry III.
and Edward I.<a name="FNanchor_547" id="FNanchor_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a> The main gateway of this bailey,
which still remains, is probably of Edward I. or
Edward II.&rsquo;s reign.<a name="FNanchor_548" id="FNanchor_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a></p>

<p>The castle of Nottingham was the most important
one in the Midlands, and William of Newburgh speaks
of it as &ldquo;so well defended by nature and art that it
appears impregnable.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_549" id="FNanchor_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a> The value of the town had
risen from £18 to £30 at the time of the Survey.<a name="FNanchor_550" id="FNanchor_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Okehampton</span>, Devon (<a href="#Fig_24">Fig. 24</a>).&mdash;Baldwin de Molis,
Sheriff of Devon, held the manor of Okehampton
at the time of the Survey, and had a castle there.<a name="FNanchor_551" id="FNanchor_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a>
On a hill in the valley of the Okement River<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
stand the remains of a castle of the motte-and-bailey
pattern. On the motte, which is high and steep, are the
ruins of a keep of late character, probably of the 14th
century.<a name="FNanchor_552" id="FNanchor_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a> The oval bailey covers &frac12; an acre, and the
whole castle is surrounded with a very deep ditch (filled
up now on the east side) which is in part a natural
ravine. The usual ditch between the motte and the
bailey is absent here. This castle appears to have
continued always in private hands, and therefore there
is little to be learned about it from the public records.
The value of Okehampton manor had increased since
the Conquest from £8 to £10. As there is no <i>burgus</i>
mentioned T. R. E., but four <i>burgenses</i> and a market
T. R. W., Baldwin the Sheriff must have built a
borough as well as a castle. Otherwise it was a small
manor of thirty ploughs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oswestry</span>, Shropshire.&mdash;Mr Eyton&rsquo;s identification
of the Domesday castle of Louvre, in the manor of
Meresberie, Shropshire, with Oswestry, seems to be
decisive.<a name="FNanchor_553" id="FNanchor_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a> The name is simply L&rsquo;&OElig;uvre, the Work, a
name very frequently given to castles in the early
Norman period. Domesday Book says that Rainald
de Bailleul built a castle at this place.<a name="FNanchor_554" id="FNanchor_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a> He had married
the widow of Warin, Sheriff of Shropshire, who died
in 1085. The castle afterwards passed into the hands
of the Fitz Alans, great lords-marcher on the Welsh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
border. As the Welsh annals give the credit of building
the castle to Madoc ap Meredith, into whose hands it fell
during the reign of Stephen, it is not impossible that
some of the masonry still existing on the motte, which
consists of large cobbles bedded in very thick mortar,
may be his work, and probably the first stonework in
the castle. A sketch made in the 18th century, however,
which is the only drawing preserved of the castle, seems
to show architecture of the Perpendicular period.<a name="FNanchor_555" id="FNanchor_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a> But
probably the keep alone was of masonry in the 12th
century, as in 1166, when the castle was in royal
custody, the repair of the stockade is referred to in the
<i>Pipe Rolls</i>.<a name="FNanchor_556" id="FNanchor_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a> No plan has been preserved of Oswestry
Castle, so that it is impossible to recover the shape or
area of the bailey, which is now built over. The manor
of Meresberie had been unoccupied (wasta) in the days
of King Edward, but it yielded 40s. at the date of
the Survey. Eyton gives reasons for thinking that
the town of Oswestry was founded by the Normans.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oxford</span> (<a href="#Fig_25">Fig. 25</a>).&mdash;This castle was built in 1071 by
Robert d&rsquo;Oilgi (or d&rsquo;Oilly), a Norman who received large
estates in Oxfordshire.<a name="FNanchor_557" id="FNanchor_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a> Oxford was a burgus in Saxon
times, and is one of those mentioned in the <i>Burghal
Hidage</i>. Domesday tells us that the king has twenty
mural mansions there, which had belonged to Algar,
Earl of Mercia, and that they were called mural mansions
because their owners had to repair the city wall at
the king&rsquo;s behest, a regulation probably as old as the
days of Alfred. The Norman castle was placed outside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
the town walls, but near the river, from which its
trenches were fed.<a name="FNanchor_558" id="FNanchor_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> It was without doubt a motte-and-bailey
castle; the motte still remains, and the accompanying
bird&rsquo;s-eye view by David Loggan, 1675, shows
that the later stone walls of the bailey stood on the
earthen banks of D&rsquo;Oilly&rsquo;s castle. The site is now
occupied by a gaol. On the line of the walls rises the
ancient tower of St George&rsquo;s Church, which so much
resembles an early Norman keep that we might think it
was intended for one, if the Osney chronicler had not
expressly told us that the church was founded two years
after the castle.<a name="FNanchor_559" id="FNanchor_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a> It is evident that the design was to
make the church tower work as a mural tower, a
combination of piety and worldly wisdom quite in accord
with what the chronicler tells us of the character of
Roger d&rsquo;Oilly.</p>

<p>Henry II. spent some £260 on this castle between
the years 1165 and 1173, the houses in the keep, and
the well being specially mentioned. We may presume
that he built with stone the decagonal [shell?] keep on
the motte, whose foundations were discovered at the end
of the 18th century.<a name="FNanchor_560" id="FNanchor_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a> There is still in the heart of the
motte a well in a very remarkable well chamber, the
masonry of which may be of his time. The area of the
bailey appears to have been 3 acres.</p>

<p>The value of the city of Oxford had trebled at the
time of the Domesday Survey.<a name="FNanchor_561" id="FNanchor_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a></p>

<p>In the treaty between Stephen and Henry in 1153
the whole castle of Oxford is spoken of as the &ldquo;Mota&rdquo;
of Oxford.<a name="FNanchor_562" id="FNanchor_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peak Castle</span>, Derbyshire.&mdash;The Survey simply calls
this castle the Castle of William Peverel, but tells us that
two Saxons had formerly held the <i>land</i>.<a name="FNanchor_563" id="FNanchor_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a> There is no
motte here, but the strong position, defended on two
sides by frightful precipices, rendered very little fortification
necessary. It is possible that the wall on the N.
and W. sides of the area may be, in part at least,
the work of William Peverel; the W. wall contains
a great deal of herring-bone work, and the tower at
the N.W. angle does not flank at all, while the other
one in the N. wall only projects a few feet; the poor
remains of the gatehouse also appear to be Norman.
It would probably be easier to build a wall than to
raise an earthbank in this stony country; nevertheless,
behind the modern wall which runs up from the gatehouse
to the keep, something like an earthbank may
be observed on the edge of the precipice, which ought
to be examined before any conclusions are determined
as to the first fortifications of this castle. The keep,
which is of different stone to the other towers and the
walls, stands on the highest ground in the area,
apparently on the natural rock, which crops up in the
basement. It is undoubtedly the work of Henry II.,
as the accounts for it remain in the <i>Pipe Rolls</i>, and the
slight indications of style which it displays, such as the
nook-shafts at the angles, correspond to the Transition
Norman period.<a name="FNanchor_564" id="FNanchor_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> The shape of the bailey is a quadrant;
its area scarcely exceeds 1 acre.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>The value of the manor had risen since the Conquest,
and William Peverel had doubled the number of ploughs
in the demesne. The castle only remained in the hands
of the Peverels for two generations, and was then
forfeited to the crown. The manor was only a small
one; and the site of the castle was probably chosen for
its natural advantages and for the facility of hunting in
the Peak Forest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Penwortham</span>, Lancashire (<a href="#Fig_24">Fig. 24</a>).&mdash;&ldquo;King Edward
held Peneverdant. There are two carucates of land
there, and they used to pay ten pence. Now there is a
castle there, and there are two ploughs in the demesne,
and six burghers, and three radmen, and eight villeins,
and four cowherds. Amongst them all they have four
ploughs. There is half a fishery there. There is wood
and hawk&rsquo;s eyries, as in King Edward&rsquo;s time. It is
worth £3.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_565" id="FNanchor_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a> The very great rise in value in this manor
shows that some great change had taken place since the
Norman Conquest. This change was the building of a
castle. The <i>modo</i> of Domesday always expresses a
contrast with King Edward&rsquo;s time, and clearly tells us
here that Penwortham Castle was new.<a name="FNanchor_566" id="FNanchor_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> It lay in the
extensive lands between the Ribble and the Mersey,
which were part of the Conqueror&rsquo;s enfeoffment of Roger
the Poitevin, third son of Earl Roger de Montgomeri.<a name="FNanchor_567" id="FNanchor_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a>
Since Penwortham is mentioned as demesne, and no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
under-tenant is spoken of, we may perhaps assume that
this castle, which was the head of a barony, was built by
Roger himself. He did not hold it long, as he forfeited
all his estates in 1102. At a later period, though we
have not been able to trace when, the manor of
Penwortham passed into the hands of the monks of
Evesham, to whom the church had already been granted,
at the end of the Conqueror&rsquo;s reign.<a name="FNanchor_568" id="FNanchor_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> Probably it is
because the castle thus passed into the hands of the
church that it never developed into a stone castle, like
Clitheroe. The seat of the barony was transferred elsewhere,
and probably the timbers of the castle were used
in the monastic buildings of Penwortham Priory.</p>

<p>The excavations which were made here in 1856
proved conclusively that there were no stone foundations
on the Castle Hill at Penwortham.<a name="FNanchor_569" id="FNanchor_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> These excavations
revealed the singular fact that the Norman had thrown
up his motte on the site of a British or Romano-British
hut, without even being aware of it, since the ruins of
the hut were buried 5 feet deep and covered by a
grass-grown surface, on which the Norman had laid a
rude pavement of boulders before piling his motte.<a name="FNanchor_570" id="FNanchor_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
Among the objects found in the excavations was a
Norman prick spur, a conclusive proof of the Norman
origin of the motte.<a name="FNanchor_571" id="FNanchor_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a> No remains appear to have been
found of the Norman wooden keep; but this would be
accounted for by the theory suggested above.</p>

<p>Penwortham is a double motte, the artificial hill
rising on the back of a natural hill, which has been
isolated from its continuing ridge by an artificial ditch
cut through it. The double hill rises out of a bailey
court which is rudely square, but whose shape is
determined by the ground, which forms a headland
running out into the Ribble. The whole area cannot
certainly be ascertained. There was a ferry at this
point in Norman times.<a name="FNanchor_572" id="FNanchor_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> The castle defends the mouth
of the Ribble and overlooks the town of Preston.</p>

<p>Penwortham was certainly not the <i>caput</i> of a large
soke in Saxon times, as it was only a berewick of
Blackburn, in which hundred it lay. It was the Norman
who first made it the seat of a barony.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peterborough.</span>&mdash;The chronicler, Hugh Candidus,
tells us that Abbot Thorold, the Norman abbot whom
William I. appointed to the ancient minster of Peterborough,
built a castle close to the church, &ldquo;which in
these days is called Mount Torold.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_573" id="FNanchor_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a> This mount is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
still existing, but it has lost its ancient name, and is
now called Tout Hill. It stands in the Deanery garden,
and has probably been largely ransacked for garden
soil, as it has a decayed and shapeless look. Still, it is a
venerable relic of Norman aggression, well authenticated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pevensey</span>, Sussex (<a href="#Fig_24">Fig. 24</a>).&mdash;The Roman castrum
of Pevensey (still so striking in its remains) was an
inhabited town at the date of the Norman Conquest,
and was an important port.<a name="FNanchor_574" id="FNanchor_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a> After taking possession
of the castrum, William I. drew a strong bank across its
eastern end, and placed a castle in the area thus isolated.
This first castle was probably entirely of wood, as there
was a wooden <i>palicium</i> on the bank as late as the reign
of Henry II.<a name="FNanchor_575" id="FNanchor_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a> But if a wooden keep was built at first,
it was very soon superseded by one of stone.<a name="FNanchor_576" id="FNanchor_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> The
remains of this keep have recently been excavated by
Mr Harold Sands and Mr Montgomerie, and show
it to have been a most remarkable building<a name="FNanchor_577" id="FNanchor_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a> (see
Chapter XII., <a href="#Page_355">p. 355</a>)&mdash;in all probability one of the few
11th century keeps in England. We may perhaps
attribute this distinction to the fact that no less a man
than the Conqueror&rsquo;s half-brother, the Count of Mortain,
was made the guardian of this important port.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>Pevensey is mentioned as a port in the <i>Close Rolls</i>
of Henry III.&rsquo;s reign, and was one of the important
waterways to the Continent.<a name="FNanchor_578" id="FNanchor_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a> As has been already noted,
the establishment of the castle was followed by the usual
rise in the value of the <i>burgus</i>.<a name="FNanchor_579" id="FNanchor_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a> The area of the castle
covers 1 acre.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pontefract</span>, Yorkshire (<a href="#Fig_26">Fig. 26</a>).&mdash;This castle is
not spoken of in Domesday by its French name, but
there can be no doubt that it is &ldquo;the Castle of Ilbert&rdquo;
which is twice mentioned and several times alluded to in
the <i>Clamores</i>, or disputed claims, which are enrolled at
the end of the list of lands in Yorkshire belonging to
the tenants-in-chief.<a name="FNanchor_580" id="FNanchor_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a> The existence of Ilbert&rsquo;s castle at
Pontefract in the 11th century is made certain by a
charter (only an early copy of which is now extant) in
the archives of the Duchy of Lancaster, in which
William Rufus at his accession regrants to Ilbert de
Lacy &ldquo;the custom of the castelry of his castle, as he had
it in the Conqueror&rsquo;s days and in those of the bishop of
Bayeux.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_581" id="FNanchor_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a> As Mr Holmes remarks, this carries us
back to four years before the compilation of Domesday
Book, since Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, whom William had
left as regent during his absence in Normandy, was
arrested and imprisoned in 1082.<a name="FNanchor_582" id="FNanchor_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a></p>

<p>Pontefract is called Kirkby in some of the earlier
charters, and this was evidently the English (or rather
the Danish) name of the place. It lay within the manor
of Tateshall, which is supposed to be the same as
Tanshelf, a name still preserved in the neighbourhood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
of, but not exactly at, Pontefract.<a name="FNanchor_583" id="FNanchor_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> Tanshelf claims to
be the Taddenescylf mentioned in the <i>Anglo-Saxon
Chronicle</i>, where King Edgar received the submission of
the Yorkshire Danes in 947. There is no proof that
the hill at Kirkby was fortified before the Conquest. It
was a steep headland rising out of the plain of the Aire,
and needing only to be scarped by art and to have a
ditch cut across its neck to be almost impregnable. It
lay scarcely a mile east of the Roman road from
Doncaster to Castleford and the north.</p>

<p>It is no part of our task to trace the fortunes of this
famous castle, which was considered in the Middle Ages
to be the key of Yorkshire.<a name="FNanchor_584" id="FNanchor_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a> In spite of the labels
affixed to the walls we venture to assert with confidence
that none of the masonry now visible belongs to the
days of Ilbert. The structural history of the castle was
probably this: Ilbert de Lacy, one of the greatest of the
Norman tenants-in-chief in Yorkshire,<a name="FNanchor_585" id="FNanchor_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a> built in this
naturally defensive situation a castle of earth and wood,
like other Norman castles. Whether he found the place
already defended by earthen banks we do not attempt to
decide, but analogy makes it fairly certain that the
motte was his work, and was crowned by a wooden
tower. This motte, which was at least partially scarped
out of the soft sandstone rock, is now disguised by the
remarkable keep which has been built up around it,
consisting at present of two enormous round towers and
the ruins of a third. As a fourth side is vacant, it may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
reasonably be conjectured that there was a fourth
roundel.<a name="FNanchor_586" id="FNanchor_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a> If the plan was a quatrefoil it resembled that
of the keep of York, which is now ascertained to belong
to the reign of Henry III.; and the very little detail
that is left supports the view that Pontefract keep was
copied from the royal experiment at York, though it
differed from it in that it actually revetted the motte
itself. There is no ditch now round the motte, but we
venture to think that its inner ditch is indicated by the
position of the postern in Piper&rsquo;s Tower, which seems to
mark its outlet. It appears to have been partly filled up
during the great siege of Pontefract in 1648.<a name="FNanchor_587" id="FNanchor_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a> The
platform which is attached to the motte on the side
facing the bailey is probably an addition of the same
date, intended for artillery; its retaining wall shows
signs of hasty construction. A well chamber and a
passage leading both to it and to a postern opening
towards the outer ditch appear to have been made in
the rocky base of the motte in the 13th century.</p>

<p>The area of the inner and probably original bailey of
this castle, including the motte, is 2&#8531; acres. The Main
Guard, and another bailey covering the approach on the
S. side, were probably later additions, bringing up the
castle area to 7 acres. The shape of the first bailey is
an irregular oval, determined by the hill on which it
stands.</p>

<p>The value of the manor of Tateshall had fallen at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
the time of the Survey from £20 to £15, an unusual
circumstance in the case of a manor which had become
the seat of an important castle; but the number of
ploughs had decreased by half, and we may infer that
Tateshall had not recovered from the great devastation
of Yorkshire in 1068.<a name="FNanchor_588" id="FNanchor_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Preston Capes</span>, Northants (<a href="#Fig_26">Fig. 26</a>).&mdash;That a
castle of the 11th century stood here is only proved by
a casual mention in the <i>Historia Fundationis</i> of the
Cluniac priory of Daventry, which tells us that this
priory was first founded by Hugh de Leycestre,
Seneschal of Matilda de Senlis, close to his own castle
of Preston Capes, about 1090. Want of water and the
proximity of the castle proving inconvenient, the priory
was removed to Daventry.<a name="FNanchor_589" id="FNanchor_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a> The work lies about 3
miles from the Watling Street. The castle stands on a
spur of high land projecting northwards towards a feeder
of the river Nesse, about 3 miles W. of the Watling
Street. The works consist of a motte, having a flat top
80 to 90 feet in diameter, and remains of a slight breastwork.
This motte is placed on the edge of the plateau,
and the ground falls steeply round its northern half.
About 16 feet down this slope, a ditch with an outer
bank has been dug, embracing half the mound. Lower
down, near the foot of the slope, is another and longer
ditch and rampart. It is probable that the bailey
occupied the flatter ground S.E. of the motte, but the
site is occupied by a farm, and no traces are visible.<a name="FNanchor_590" id="FNanchor_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>The value of the manor of Preston Capes had risen
from 6s. to 40s. at the time of the Survey. It was held
by Nigel of the Count of Mellent.<a name="FNanchor_591" id="FNanchor_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quatford</span>, Shropshire (<a href="#Fig_26">Fig. 26</a>).&mdash;There can hardly
be any doubt that the <i>nova domus</i> at Quatford
mentioned in the Survey was the new castle built by
Roger de Montgomeri, Earl of Shrewsbury. We have
already suggested that the <i>burgus</i> which also existed
there may have been his work, and not that of the
Danes.<a name="FNanchor_592" id="FNanchor_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a> The manor belonged to the church before the
Conquest.<a name="FNanchor_593" id="FNanchor_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a> The oval motte, which still remains, is
described as placed on a bold rocky promontory jutting
into the Severn; it is not quite 30 feet high, and about
60 feet by 120 in diameter on top, and has a small
bean-shaped bailey of 1 acre. It is near the church,
which has Norman remains.<a name="FNanchor_594" id="FNanchor_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a> Robert Belesme, son of
Earl Roger, removed the castle to Bridgenorth, and so
the Quatford castle is heard of no more.<a name="FNanchor_595" id="FNanchor_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a> The manor
of Quatford was paying nothing at the date of the
Survey.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rayleigh</span>, Essex (<a href="#Fig_27">Fig. 27</a>).&mdash;&ldquo;In this manor Sweyn
has made his castle.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_596" id="FNanchor_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a> Sweyn was the son of Robert
Fitz-Wymarc, a half English, half Norman favourite of
Edward the Confessor. Robert was Sheriff of Essex
under Edward and William, and Sweyn appears to have
succeeded his father in this office.<a name="FNanchor_597" id="FNanchor_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a> Sweyn built his
castle on land which had not belonged to his father, so
Rayleigh cannot be the &ldquo;Robert&rsquo;s Castle&rdquo; of the <i>Anglo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>-Saxon
Chronicle</i>, to which some of the Norman
adventurers fled on the triumph of Earl Godwin.<a name="FNanchor_598" id="FNanchor_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a> There
is a fine motte at Rayleigh, and a semicircular bailey
attached; the ditch round the whole is still well marked.
There is not a vestige of masonry on the surface, but
some excavations made in 1910 revealed stone foundations.
The inner bailey covers &frac34; of an acre. The
value of the manor had risen since the Conquest, but it
was only a small one, with no villages in its soke.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard&rsquo;s Castle</span>, Herefordshire (<a href="#Fig_27">Fig. 27</a>).&mdash;There
can be little doubt that this is the castle referred to in
Domesday Book under the name of Avreton, as it is
not far from Overton, on the northern border of
Hereford.<a name="FNanchor_599" id="FNanchor_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a> Richard&rsquo;s Castle is almost certainly the
castle of Richard, son of Scrob, one of the Normans to
whom Edward the Confessor had granted large estates,
and who probably fortified himself on this site. At the
time of the Survey Richard was dead, and the castle
was held by his son Osbern, and it is noted that he
pays 10s., but the castle is worth 20s. to him. Its value
was the same as in King Edward&rsquo;s time, a fact worth
noting, as it coincides with the assumption that this
was a pre-Conquest castle. There is a high and steep
motte at Richard&rsquo;s Castle, and a small half-moon shaped
bailey.<a name="FNanchor_600" id="FNanchor_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a> There are remains of a stone wing wall running
down the motte, and on the top there is a straight piece
of masonry which must be part of a tower keep. The
area of the inner bailey is &#8532; of an acre. Avreton was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
not the centre of a soke, but appears to have lain in the
manor of Ludeford.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richmond</span>, Yorks (<a href="#Fig_28">Fig. 28</a>).&mdash;As in the case of
Pontefract, this other great Yorkshire castle is not
mentioned by name in Domesday Book, nor is there
any allusion to it except a casual mention in the
<i>Recapitulation</i> that Earl Alan has 199 manors in his
castelry, and that besides the castelry he has 43
manors.<a name="FNanchor_601" id="FNanchor_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a> The castle must have been built at the date
of the Survey, which was completed only a year before
William I.&rsquo;s death; for during William&rsquo;s lifetime Earl
Alan, the first holder of the fief, gave <i>the chapel in the
castle of Richmond</i> to the abbey of St Mary at York,
which he had founded.<a name="FNanchor_602" id="FNanchor_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a> The name, of course, is French,
and it seems impossible now to discover what English
manor-name it has displaced.<a name="FNanchor_603" id="FNanchor_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a> It is certainly a case in
which the Norman castle was not placed in the seat of
the former Saxon proprietor, but in the site which
seemed most defensible to the Norman lord. The
lands of Earl Alan in the wapentake of Gilling had
belonged to the Saxon Earl Edwin, and thus cannot
have fallen to Alan&rsquo;s share before Edwin&rsquo;s death in 1071.
The <i>Genealogia</i> published by Dodsworth (from an MS.
compiled in the reign of Edward III.), says that Earl
Alan first built Richmond Castle near his chief manor
of Gilling, to defend his people against the attacks of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
the disinherited English and Danes.<a name="FNanchor_604" id="FNanchor_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a> The passage has
been enlarged by Camden, who says that Alan
&ldquo;thought himself not safe enough in Gilling&rdquo;; and
this has been interpreted to mean that Alan originally
built his castle at Gilling, and afterwards removed it to
Richmond; but the original words have no such
meaning.<a name="FNanchor_605" id="FNanchor_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a></p>

<p>Richmond Castle differs from most of the castles
mentioned in Domesday in that it has no motte. The
ground plan indeed was very like that of a motte-and-bailey
castle, in that old maps show a small roundish
enclosure at the apex of the large triangular bailey.<a name="FNanchor_606" id="FNanchor_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a>
But a recent examination of the keep by Messrs Hope
and Brakespear has confirmed the theory first enunciated
by Mr Loftus Brock,<a name="FNanchor_607" id="FNanchor_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a> that the keep is built over the
original gateway of the castle, and that the lower stage
of its front wall is the ancient wall of the castle. The
small ward indicated in the old maps is therefore most
likely a barbican, of later date than the 12th century
keep, which is probably rightly attributed by the
<i>Genealogia</i> cited above to Earl Conan, who reigned
from 1148-1171.<a name="FNanchor_608" id="FNanchor_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a> Some entries in the <i>Pipe Rolls</i>
make it almost certain that it was finished by Henry II.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
who kept the castle in his own hands for some time after
the death of Conan.<a name="FNanchor_609" id="FNanchor_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a> There are some indications at
Richmond that the first castle was of stone and not of
earth and wood. The walls do not stand on earthen
banks; the Norman curtain can still be traced on two
sides of the castle, and on the west side it seems of
early construction, containing a great deal of herringbone
work, and might possibly be the work of Earl
Alan.</p>

<div class="caption">Rochester, Kent.</div>
</div></div>
<div class="caption">Fig. 28.</div>

<p>The whole area of the castle is 2&frac12; acres, including
the annexe known as the Cockpit. This was certainly
enclosed during the Norman period, as it has a Norman
gateway in its wall.</p>

<p>As we do not know the name of the site of
Richmond before the Conquest, and as the name of
Richmond is not mentioned in Domesday Book, we
cannot tell whether the value of the manor had risen or
fallen. But no part of Yorkshire was more flourishing
at the time of the Survey than this wapentake of
Gilling, which belonged to Earl Alan; in no district,
except in the immediate neighbourhood of York, are
there so many places where the value has risen. Yet
the greater part of it was let out to under-tenants.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rochester</span>, Kent (<a href="#Fig_28">Fig. 28</a>).&mdash;Under the heading
of Aylsford, Kent, the Survey tells us that &ldquo;the bishop
of Rochester holds as much of this land as is worth
17s. 4d. <i>in exchange for the land in which the castle
sits</i>.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_610" id="FNanchor_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> Rochester was a Roman <i>castrum</i>, and portions
of its Roman wall have recently been found.<a name="FNanchor_611" id="FNanchor_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a> The fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
that various old charters speak of the <i>castellum</i> of
Rochester has led some authorities to believe that there
was a castle there in Saxon times, but the context of
these charters shows plainly that the words <i>castellum
Roffense</i> were equivalent to <i>Castrum Roffense</i> or
<i>Hrofesceastre</i>.<a name="FNanchor_612" id="FNanchor_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a> Otherwise there is not a particle of
evidence for the existence of a castle at Rochester in
pre-Norman times, and the passage in Domesday
quoted above shows that William&rsquo;s castle was a new
erection, built on land obtained by exchange from the
church.</p>

<p>Outside the line of the Roman wall, to the south of
the city, and west of the south gate, there is a district
called Boley or Bullie Hill, which at one time was
included in the fortifications of the present castle. It
is a continuation of the ridge on which that castle
stands, and has been separated from it by a ditch.
This ditch once entirely surrounded it, and though it was
partly filled up in the 18th century its line can still be
traced. The area enclosed by this ditch was about 3
acres; the form appears to have been oblong. In the
grounds of Satis House, one of the villas which have been
built on this site, there still remains a conical artificial
mound, much reduced in size, as it has been converted
into a pleasure-ground with winding walks, but the
retaining walls of these walks are composed of old
materials; and towards the riverside there are still
vestiges of an ancient wall.<a name="FNanchor_613" id="FNanchor_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a> We venture to think that
this Boley Hill and its motte formed the original site<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
of the (probably) wooden castle of William the Conqueror.
Its nature, position, and size correspond to what we
have already observed as characteristic of the first
castles of the Conquest. It stands on land which
originally belonged to the church of St Andrew, as
Domesday Book tells us William&rsquo;s castle did.<a name="FNanchor_614" id="FNanchor_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a> The
very name may be interpreted in favour of this theory.<a name="FNanchor_615" id="FNanchor_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a>
And that there was no Roman or Saxon fortification
on the spot is proved by excavations, which have shown
that both a Roman and a Saxon cemetery occupied
portions of the area.<a name="FNanchor_616" id="FNanchor_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a></p>

<p>It is well known that between the years 1087 and
1089 the celebrated architect, Gundulf, Bishop of
Rochester, built a new <i>stone</i> castle for William Rufus,
&ldquo;in the best part of the city of Rochester.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_617" id="FNanchor_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a> This
castle, of course, was on the same site as the present
one, though the splendid keep was not built till the next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
reign.<a name="FNanchor_618" id="FNanchor_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a> But if what we have maintained above be
correct the castle of Gundulf was built on a different
site from that of the castle of William. Nor are we
without evidence in support of this. What remains of
the original Norman wall of Gundulf&rsquo;s castle (and
enough remains to show that the circuit was complete
in Norman times) does not stand on earthen banks;
and this, though not a proof, is a strong suggestion that
there was no earthen bank belonging to some previous
castle when Gundulf began his building.<a name="FNanchor_619" id="FNanchor_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a> But further,
Mr Livett has shown in his paper on <i>Mediæval Rochester</i><a name="FNanchor_620" id="FNanchor_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a>
that in order to form a level plateau for the court of the
castle the ground had to be artificially made up on the
north and east sides, and in these places the wall rests
on a foundation of gravel, which has been forcibly
rammed to make it solid, and which goes through the
artificial soil to the natural chalk below. Now what
can this rammed gravel mean but an expedient to avoid
the danger of building in stone on freshly heaped soil?
Had the artificial platform been in existence ever since
the Conquest, it would have been solid enough to build
upon without this expense. It is therefore at least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
probable that Bishop Gundulf&rsquo;s castle was built on an
entirely new site.</p>

<p>It seems also to be clear that the Boley Hill was
included as an outwork in Bishop Gundulf&rsquo;s plan, for
the castle ditch is cut through the Roman wall near the
south gate of the city.<a name="FNanchor_621" id="FNanchor_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a> Mr Livett remarks that
King John appears to have used the hill as a point of
vantage when he attacked the city in 1215, and he
thinks this was probably the reason why Henry III.&rsquo;s
engineers enclosed it with a stone wall when they
restored the walls of the city.<a name="FNanchor_622" id="FNanchor_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> Henry III.&rsquo;s wall has
been traced all round the city, and at the second south
gate it turns at right angles, or nearly so, so as to
enclose Boley Hill.<a name="FNanchor_623" id="FNanchor_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a> It is probable, as Mr Livett
suggests, that the drawbridge and <i>bretasche</i>, or wooden
tower, ordered in 1226 for the southern side of
Rochester Castle,<a name="FNanchor_624" id="FNanchor_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a> were intended to connect the Boley
Hill court with the main castle. In 1722 the owner
of the castle (which had then fallen into private hands)
conveyed to one Philip Brooke, &ldquo;that part of the castle
ditch and ground, as it then lay unenclosed, on Bully
Hill, being the whole breadth of the hill and ditch
without the walls of the castle, extending from thence
to the river Medway.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_625" id="FNanchor_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a></p>

<p>The general opinion about the Boley Hill is that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
it is a Danish earthwork, thrown up by the Danes when
they besieged the city in 885. But if our contention
in <a href="#CHAPTER_IV">Chapter IV</a>. is just, the Danish fortifications were
not mottes, nor anything like them; and (as has already
been pointed out) the <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i> indicates
the nature of the fortress in this case by its expression,
&ldquo;they made a work around themselves&rdquo;;<a name="FNanchor_626" id="FNanchor_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a> that is, it
was a circumvallation. Moreover, at Rochester the
Danes would have had to pass under the bridge (which
is known to have existed both in Roman and Saxon
times) in order to get to the Boley Hill; and even if
their ships were small enough to do this they would
hardly have been so foolish as to leave a bridge in their
possible line of retreat. It is therefore far more likely
that their fastness was somewhere to the north or east
of the city.<a name="FNanchor_627" id="FNanchor_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a></p>

<p>It is a noteworthy fact that up till very recently the
Boley Hill had a special jurisdiction of its own, under an
officer called the Baron of the Bully, appointed by the
Recorder of the city. This appears to date from a
charter of Edward IV. in 1460, which confirms the
former liberties of the citizens of Rochester, and ordains
that they should keep two courts&rsquo; leet and a court of pie-powder
annually on the Bullie Hill. The anonymous
historian of Rochester remarks that it was thought
that the baron represented the first officer under the
governor of the castle before the court leet was
instituted, to whose care the security of the Bullie
Hill was entrusted.<a name="FNanchor_628" id="FNanchor_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a> This is probably much nearer
the truth than the theory which would assign such
thoroughly feudal courts as those of court leet and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
pie-powder to an imaginary community of Danes residing
on the Boley Hill. When we compare the case
of the Boley Hill with the somewhat similar cases
of Chester and Norwich castles we shall see that what
took place in Edward IV.&rsquo;s reign was probably this:
the separate jurisdiction which had once belonged
to an abandoned castle site was transferred to the
citizens of Rochester, but with the usual conservatism of
mediæval legislation, it was not absorbed in the jurisdiction
of the city.</p>

<p>The value of Rochester at the time of the Survey
had risen from 100<i>s.</i> to 20<i>l.</i><a name="FNanchor_629" id="FNanchor_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a> The increase of trade,
arising from the security of traffic which was provided
by William&rsquo;s castles on this important route, no doubt
accounts in great measure for this remarkable rise in
value.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rockingham</span>, Northants (<a href="#Fig_29">Fig. 29</a>).&mdash;Here, also,
the castle was clearly new in William&rsquo;s reign, as the
manor was uninhabited (<i>wasta</i>) until a castle was built
there by his orders, in consequence of which the manor
produced a small revenue at the time of the Survey.<a name="FNanchor_630" id="FNanchor_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a>
The motte, now in great part destroyed, was a large
one, being about 80 feet in diameter at the top;
attached to it is a bailey of irregular but rectilateral
shape (determined by the ground) covering about 3
acres. There is another large bailey to the S.
covering 4 acres, formed by cutting a ditch across the
spur of the hill on which the castle stands, which is
probably later. The first castle would undoubtedly be
of wood, and it is probable that King John was the
builder of the &ldquo;exceeding fair and strong&rdquo; keep which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
stood on the motte in Leland&rsquo;s time,<a name="FNanchor_631" id="FNanchor_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a> as there is an entry
in the <i>Pipe Roll</i> of the thirteenth year of his reign for
126<i>l.</i> 18<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for the work of the new tower.<a name="FNanchor_632" id="FNanchor_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a> This
keep, if Mr Clark is correct, was polygonal, with a
timber stockade surrounding it.</p>

<p>Rockingham was only a small manor of one hide in
Saxon times, though its Saxon owner had sac and soke.
It stands in a forest district, not near any of the great
ancient lines of road, and was probably built for a
hunting seat.</p>

<p>The value of the manor had risen at the time of the
Survey.<a name="FNanchor_633" id="FNanchor_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a></p>

<p>During the Civil War, the motte of Rockingham was
fortified in an elaborate manner by the Parliamentarians,
part of the defences being two wooden stockades:<a name="FNanchor_634" id="FNanchor_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a> an
interesting instance of the use both of mottes and of
wooden fortifications in comparatively modern warfare.
Only the north and west sides of this mount now
remain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Sarum</span>, Wilts (<a href="#Fig_30">Fig. 30</a>).&mdash;Sir Richard Colt
Hoare printed in his <i>Ancient Wiltshire</i> a document
purporting to be an order from Alfred, &ldquo;King of the
English,&rdquo; to Leofric, &ldquo;Earl of Wiltunshire,&rdquo; to maintain
the castle of Sarum, and add another ditch to it.<a name="FNanchor_635" id="FNanchor_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a> The
phraseology of the document suggests some doubts of
its genuineness, and though there would be nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
improbable in the theory that Alfred reared the outer
bank of the fortress, recent excavations have shown that
the place was occupied by the Romans, and therefore
make it certain that its origin was very much earlier than
Alfred&rsquo;s time. Moreover, the convergence of several
Roman roads at this spot suggests the probability of a
Roman station,<a name="FNanchor_636" id="FNanchor_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a> while the form of the enclosure renders
an earlier origin likely. Domesday Book does not speak
of Salisbury as a <i>burgus</i>, and when the <i>burgus</i> of Old
Sarum is mentioned in later documents it appears to
refer to a district lying at the foot of the Castle Hill, and
formerly enclosed with a wall.<a name="FNanchor_637" id="FNanchor_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a> Nor is it one of the
boroughs of the <i>Burghal Hidage</i>. But that Sarum was
an important place in Saxon times is clear from the fact
that there was a mint there; and there is evidence of
the existence of at least four Saxon churches, as well as
a hospital for lepers.<a name="FNanchor_638" id="FNanchor_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a></p>

<p>For more exact knowledge as to the history of this
ancient fortress we must wait till the excavations now
going on are finished, but in the meanwhile it seems
probable that the theory adopted by General Pitt-Rivers
is correct. He regarded Old Sarum as a British earthwork,
with an inner castle and outer barbicans added by
the Normans. After building this castle in the midst of
it the Normans appear to have considered the outer and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
larger fortification too valuable to be given up to the
public, but retained it under the government of the
castellan, and treated it as part of the castle.</p>

<p>There is no mention of the castle of Salisbury in
Domesday Book, but the bishop is named as the owner
of the manor.<a name="FNanchor_639" id="FNanchor_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a> The episcopal see of Sherborne was
transferred to Sarum in 1076 by Bishop Hermann, in
accordance with the policy adopted by William I. that
episcopal sees should be removed from villages to
towns:<a name="FNanchor_640" id="FNanchor_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a> a measure which in itself is a testimony to the
importance of Salisbury at that time. The first mention
of the castle is in the charter of Bishop Osmund, 1091.<a name="FNanchor_641" id="FNanchor_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a>
The bishop was allowed to lay the foundations of his
new cathedral within the ancient fortress. As might be
expected, friction soon arose between the castellans and
the ecclesiastics; the castellans claimed the custody of
the gates, and sometimes barred the canons, whose
houses seem to have been outside the fortress, from
access to the church. These quarrels were ended
eventually by the removal of the cathedral to the new
town of Salisbury at the foot of the hill.</p>

<div id="Fig_30" class="figure"><div class="subfigure">
<a href="images/fig30-large.png"><img src="images/fig30.png" width="600" height="406" alt="" /></a>
<div class="caption">Old Sarum, Wilts.</div>
</div></div>
<div class="caption">Fig. 30.</div>

<p>The position of the motte of Old Sarum is exceptional,
as it stands in the centre of the outer fortress.
This must be owing to the position of the ancient
vallum, encircling the summit of one of those round,
gradually sloping hills so common in the chalk ranges,
which made it necessary to place the motte in the centre,
because it was the highest part of the ground. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
present excavations have shown that it is in part
artificial. But though the citadel was thus exceptionally
placed, the principle that communication with the
outside must be maintained was carried out; the motte
had its own bailey, reaching to the outer vallum. The
remains of three cross banks still exist, two of which
must have enclosed the <i>magnum ballium</i> which is spoken
of in the <i>Pipe Rolls</i> of Henry II. Probably this bailey
occupied the south-eastern third of the circle, which
included the main gateway and the road to the citadel.
In the ditch on the north side of this enclosure, an
arched passage, apparently of Norman construction, was
found in 1795; it was doubtless a postern or sallyport.<a name="FNanchor_642" id="FNanchor_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a>
The main entrance is defended by a separate mount
with its own ditch, which is conjectured to be of later
date than the vallum itself. The area of the top of the
motte is about 1&frac34; acres, a larger size than usual, but not
larger than that of several other important castles.<a name="FNanchor_643" id="FNanchor_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a> In
Leland&rsquo;s time there was &ldquo;much notable ruinous building&rdquo;
still remaining of this fortress, and the excavations
have already revealed the lower portions of some
splendid walls and gateways, and the basement of a
late Norman keep which presents some unusual
features.<a name="FNanchor_644" id="FNanchor_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a> The earthworks, however, bear witness to
a former wooden stockade both to the citadel and the
outer enclosure. The top of the motte is still surrounded
by high earthen banks.</p>

<p>As that great building bishop, Roger of Salisbury<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
(1099-1139), is said to have environed the castle with a
new wall,<a name="FNanchor_645" id="FNanchor_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a> it would seem likely that he was the first to
transform the castle from wood to stone. But in Henry
II.&rsquo;s reign, we find an entry in the <i>Pipe Rolls</i> for
materials for enclosing the great bailey. An order
for the destruction of the castle had been issued by
Stephen,<a name="FNanchor_646" id="FNanchor_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a> but it is doubtful whether it was carried out.
The sums spent by Henry II. on the castle do not
amount to more than £266, 12s. 5d., but the work
recently excavated which appears to be of his date is
very extensive indeed.</p>

<p>The mention of a small wooden tower in Richard I.&rsquo;s
reign shows that some parts of the defences were still
of wood at that date.<a name="FNanchor_647" id="FNanchor_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a> Timber and rods for <i>hoarding</i>
the castle, that is, for the wooden machicolations placed
at the tops of towers and walls, were ordered at the end
of John&rsquo;s reign.<a name="FNanchor_648" id="FNanchor_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a></p>

<p>It is not known when the castle was abandoned, but
the list of castellans ceases in the reign of Henry VI.,
when it was granted to the Stourton family.<a name="FNanchor_649" id="FNanchor_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a> Though
the earls of Salisbury were generally the custodians of
Sarum Castle, except in the time of Bishop Roger, it
was always considered a royal castle, while the manor
belonged to the bishop.<a name="FNanchor_650" id="FNanchor_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a> It is remarked in the <i>Hundred
Rolls</i> of Henry III., that no one holds fiefs for ward in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
this castle, and that nothing belonged to the castle
outside the gate.<a name="FNanchor_651" id="FNanchor_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a></p>

<p>The value of the manor of Salisbury appears to have
risen very greatly since the Conquest.<a name="FNanchor_652" id="FNanchor_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shrewsbury</span> (<a href="#Fig_31">Fig. 31</a>).&mdash;The passage in Domesday
Book relating to this town has been called by Mr
Round one of the most important in the Survey, and it
is of special importance for our present purpose. &ldquo;The
English burghers of Shrewsbury say that it is very
grievous to them that they have to pay all the geld
which they paid in King Edward&rsquo;s time, although the
castle of the earl occupies [the site of] 51 houses, and
another 50 are uninhabited.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_653" id="FNanchor_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a> It is incomprehensible
how in the face of such a clear statement as this, that
the new castle occupied the site of fifty-one houses, anyone
should be found gravely to maintain that the motte
at Shrewsbury was an English work; for if the
motte stood there before, what was the clearance of
houses made for? The only answer could be to
enlarge the bailey. But this is exactly what the
Norman would not wish to do; he would want only
a small area for the small force at his disposal for
defence. Shrewsbury was certainly a borough (that
is, a fortified town) in Anglo-Saxon times; probably
it was one of the towns fortified by Ethelfleda, though
it is not mentioned by name in the list of those
towns furnished by the <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i>.<a name="FNanchor_654" id="FNanchor_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a> Its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
ancient walls were certainly only of earth and wood,
for a writ of 1231 says that the old stockade and the
old bretasche of the old ditch of the town of Shrewsbury
are to be granted to the burghers for strengthening
the new ditch.<a name="FNanchor_655" id="FNanchor_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a></p>

<p>The castle of Shrewsbury was built on the neck of
the peninsula on which the town stands, and on the line
of the town walls. The oval motte, which still remains,
stands, as usual, on the line of the castle banks, and
slopes steeply down to the Severn on one side. Its
nearness to the river made it liable to damage by floods.
Thus we find Henry II. spending 5<i>l.</i> on the repair of
the motte,<a name="FNanchor_656" id="FNanchor_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a> and in Edward I.&rsquo;s reign the abbot&rsquo;s mill is
accused of having caused damage to the extent of 60
marks to the motte. But the men of the hundred
exonerate the mill, and from another passage the blame
appears to lie on the fall of a great wooden tower.<a name="FNanchor_657" id="FNanchor_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a>
This can hardly have been other than the wooden keep
on the motte, and thus we learn the interesting fact that
as late as Edward I.&rsquo;s reign the castle of Shrewsbury<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
had only a wooden keep. The present tower on the
motte is the work of Telford.</p>

<p>The bailey of Shrewsbury Castle is roughly semilunar
and covers nearly an acre. The walls stand on
banks, which shows that the first wall was of timber.
The Norman entrance arch seems to render it probable
that it was in Henry II.&rsquo;s reign that stone walls were
first substituted for a wooden stockade, and the <i>Pipe
Rolls</i> contain several entries of sums spent by Henry on
this castle.<a name="FNanchor_658" id="FNanchor_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a> But the first mention of stone in connection
with the castle is in the reign of Henry III.<a name="FNanchor_659" id="FNanchor_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a> In
the reign of Edward I., a <i>jarola</i> or wooden wall, which
had been raised above the outer ditch in the time of
the Barons&rsquo; War, was replaced by a stone wall.<a name="FNanchor_660" id="FNanchor_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a> This
perhaps refers to the second bailey, now destroyed,
which lay to the south of the castle. In the time of
Charles I. the castle still had a wooden palisade on the
counterscarp of the ditch.<a name="FNanchor_661" id="FNanchor_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a> The two large drum towers
on the walls, and the building between them, now
converted into a modern house, belong to a much later
period than the walls. The area of the present castle,
including the motte, is &#8536; of an acre.</p>

<p>The value of the town of Shrewsbury had risen
since the Conquest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Skipsea</span>, Yorks (<a href="#Fig_31">Fig. 31</a>).&mdash;There is no mention
of this castle in Domesday Book, but the chronicle of
Meaux Abbey tells us that it was built by Drogo de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
Bevrère in the reign of William I.<a name="FNanchor_662" id="FNanchor_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a> This chronicle is
not indeed contemporary, but its most recent editor
regards it as based on some much earlier document.
It was the key of the great manor of Holderness, which
the Conqueror had given to Drogo, but which Drogo
forfeited by murdering his wife, probably on this very
site. The situation of Skipsea is remarkable, but the
original plan of Kenilworth Castle presented a close
parallel to it. The motte, which is 46 feet high, and
&#8533; of an acre in space on top, is separated from
the bailey by a level space, which was formerly the
Mere of Skipsea, mentioned in documents of the 13th
century, which reckon the take of eels in this mere as a
source of revenue.<a name="FNanchor_663" id="FNanchor_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a> The motte thus formed an island in
the mere, but as an additional defence&mdash;perhaps when
the mere began to get shallow&mdash;it was surrounded by a
bank and ditch of its own. No masonry is to be seen
on the motte now, except a portion of a wing wall going
down it. It is connected with its bailey on the other
side of the mere by a causeway which still exists. This
bailey is of very unusual size, covering 8&frac14; acres; its
banks still retain the name of the Baile Welts, and
one of the entrances is called the Baile Gate.
Skipsea Brough, which no doubt represents the former
<i>burgus</i> of Skipsea, is outside this enclosure, and has
no defences of its own remaining. A mandate of
Henry III. in 1221, ordered the complete destruction
of this castle,<a name="FNanchor_664" id="FNanchor_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a> and it was no doubt after this
that the earls of Albemarle, who had succeeded
to Drogo&rsquo;s estates, removed their <i>caput baroniæ</i> to
Burstwick.<a name="FNanchor_665" id="FNanchor_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>The value of the manor of Cleeton, in which Skipsea
lies, had fallen at Domesday.<a name="FNanchor_666" id="FNanchor_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stafford</span> (<a href="#Fig_32">Fig. 32</a>).&mdash;The <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i>
says that Ethelfleda of Mercia built the <i>burh</i> of Stafford;
and consequently we find that both in King Edward
and King William&rsquo;s time Stafford was a burgus, or
fortified town. Florence of Worcester, who is considered
to have used a superior copy of the <i>Chronicle</i> as
the foundation of his work, says that Ethelfleda built an
<i>arx</i> on the north bank of the Sowe in 914. <i>Arx</i>, in
our earlier chronicles, is often only a bombastic expression
for a walled town, as, for example, when Ethelwerd
says that Ethelfleda&rsquo;s body was buried in St Peter&rsquo;s
porch in the <i>arx</i> of Gloucester.<a name="FNanchor_667" id="FNanchor_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a> But the statement led
many later writers, such as Camden, to imagine that
Ethelfleda built a <i>tower</i> in the town of Stafford; and
these imaginings have created such a tangled skein of
mistake that we must bespeak our readers&rsquo; patience
while we attempt to unravel it.</p>

<p>Domesday Book only mentions Stafford Castle under
the manor of Chebsey, a possession of Henry de Ferrers.
Its words are: &ldquo;To this manor <i>belonged</i> the land of
Stafford, in which the king commanded a castle to be
built, which is now destroyed.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_668" id="FNanchor_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a> Ordericus also says
that the king placed a castle at Stafford, on his return
from his third visit to the north, in 1070.<a name="FNanchor_669" id="FNanchor_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a> Now the
language of Domesday appears to us to say very plainly
that in the manorial rearrangement which followed the
Conquest some land was taken out of the manor of
Chebsey, which lies immediately to the south of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
borough of Stafford, to furnish a site for a royal castle.<a name="FNanchor_670" id="FNanchor_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a>
It is exactly in this position that we now find a large
oblong motte, similar to the other mottes of the
Conquest, and having the usual bailey attached to it.
It lies about a mile and a half south-west of the town,
near the main road leading into Shropshire.</p>

<p>The position was an important one, as the castles of
Staffordshire formed a second line of defence against the
North Welsh, as well as a check to the great palatinate
earls of Shropshire.<a name="FNanchor_671" id="FNanchor_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a> The motte itself stood on high
ground, commanding a view of twenty or thirty miles
round, and both Tutbury and Caus castles could
be seen from it. Between it and the town lies a stretch
of flat ground which has evidently been a swamp
formerly, and which explains the distance of the castle
from the town; while the fact that it lies to the <i>south</i> of
the Sowe shows that it has no connection with Ethelfleda&rsquo;s
work. There is no dispute that this motte was
the site of the later baronial castle of Stafford, the castle
besieged and taken in the Civil War; the point we have
to prove is that it was also the castle of Domesday
Book.<a name="FNanchor_672" id="FNanchor_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a></p>

<p>If the first castle of Stafford was of earth and wood,
like most of William&rsquo;s castles, there would be nothing
wonderful in its having many destructions and many
resurrections. This castle was clearly a royal castle,
from the language of Domesday Book. As a royal
castle it would be committed to the custody of the sheriff,
who appears to have been Robert de Stafford,<a name="FNanchor_673" id="FNanchor_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a> ancestor
of the later barons of Stafford, and brother of Ralph de
Todeni, one of the great nobles of the Conquest. Ralph
joined the party of Robert Curthose against Henry I. in
1101, and it is conjectured that his brother Robert was
involved in the same rebellion, for in that year we find
the castle held for the king by William Pantolf, a trusty
companion of the Conqueror.<a name="FNanchor_674" id="FNanchor_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a> It is very unlikely that
this second castle of Stafford was on a different site from
the one which had been destroyed; and an ingenious
conjecture of Mr Mazzinghi&rsquo;s helps us to identify it with
the castle on the motte. In that castle, when it again
emerges into light in the reign of Henry II., we find a
chapel dedicated to St Nicholas, which Robert de
Stafford gives to the abbey of Stone, and the king
confirms the gift.<a name="FNanchor_675" id="FNanchor_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a> The worship of St Nicholas came
greatly into fashion after the translation of his remains
from Asia Minor to Bari, in Italy, in 1087. William
Pantolf visited the shrine at Bari, got possession of
some of the relics of St Nicholas, and with great
reverence deposited them in his own church of Noron,
in Normandy.<a name="FNanchor_676" id="FNanchor_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a> It is therefore extremely probable that
Pantolf founded the chapel of St Nicholas in Stafford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
Castle during the time that the castle was in his custody.<a name="FNanchor_677" id="FNanchor_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a>
But about the situation of the chapel of St Nicholas
there is no doubt, as its history is traceable down to the
16th century. It stood in the bailey of the castle
outside the town. This castle was therefore certainly
identical with that of Henry II., and most probably
with that of Henry I. and William I.</p>

<p>So far, as we have seen, Stafford Castle was a royal
castle. It is true that in the reign of Henry II.&rsquo;s
predecessor, Stephen, we find the castle again in the
hands of a Robert de Stafford, who speaks of it as
&ldquo;castellum meum.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_678" id="FNanchor_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a> Apparently the troubles of
Stephen&rsquo;s reign afforded an opportunity to the family of
the first Norman sheriff to get the castle again into their
hands. But under the stronger rule of Henry II. the
crown recovered its rights, and the gift of the chapel in
the castle evidently could not be made without the
consent of the king. The gaol which Henry II. caused
to be made in Stafford was doubtless in this castle.<a name="FNanchor_679" id="FNanchor_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a>
John repaired the castle,<a name="FNanchor_680" id="FNanchor_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a> and ordered <i>bretasches</i>, or
wooden towers, to be made in the forest of Arundel,
and sent to Stafford:<a name="FNanchor_681" id="FNanchor_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a> a statement which gives us an
insight into the nature of the castle in John&rsquo;s reign.
But it was the tendency of sheriffdoms to become
hereditary, as Dr Stubbs has pointed out,<a name="FNanchor_682" id="FNanchor_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a> and this
seems to have been the case at Stafford. In the reign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
of Edward I. a local jury decided that Nicholas, Baron
of Stafford, held the castle of Stafford from the king <i>in
capite</i>, by the service of three and a half knights&rsquo; fees;<a name="FNanchor_683" id="FNanchor_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a>
and in 1348, Ralph, Baron of Stafford, obtained a
license from Edward III. &ldquo;to fortify and crenellate his
<i>manses</i> of Stafford and Madlee with a wall of stone and
lime, and to make castles thereof.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_684" id="FNanchor_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a> The indenture
made with the mason a year previously is still extant,
and states that the castle is to be built upon the <i>moële</i>
in the manor, whereby the motte is evidently meant.<a name="FNanchor_685" id="FNanchor_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a>
Besides, the deed is dated &ldquo;at the Chastel of Stafford,&rdquo;
showing that the new castle of stone and lime was on
the site of an already existing castle.</p>

<p>We might spin out further evidence of the identity
of the site of William&rsquo;s castle with that of the present
one, from the name of the manor of Castel, which grew
up around it, displacing the equally suggestive name of
Montville, which we find in Domesday Book.<a name="FNanchor_686" id="FNanchor_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a> Against
the existence of another castle in the town we have the
absence of any such castle in William Smith&rsquo;s plan of
1588; the silence of Speed and Leland, who only
mention the present castle;<a name="FNanchor_687" id="FNanchor_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a> and the statement of Plot,
who wrote about the end of the 17th century, that &ldquo;he
could not hear any footsteps remaining&rdquo; of a castle in
Stafford.<a name="FNanchor_688" id="FNanchor_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a> We may therefore safely conclude that it was
only due to the fancy of some Elizabethan antiquary
that in an old map of that time a spot to the south<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>-west
of the town is marked with the inscription, &ldquo;The
old castle, built by Edward the Elder, and in memorie
fortified with reel walls.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_689" id="FNanchor_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a></p>

<p>The value of Stafford town had risen at the time of
the Survey, as the king had 7<i>l.</i> for his share, which
would make the whole revenue to king and earl 10<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i>,
as against 9<i>l.</i> before the Conquest. The property of
the canons of Stafford had risen from £1 to £3.<a name="FNanchor_690" id="FNanchor_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a></p>

<p>The area of the bailey is 1&#8535; acres.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stamford</span>, Lincoln and Northants.&mdash;This was one
of the boroughs fortified by Edward the Elder, and
consequently we find it a royal <i>burgus</i> at the time of the
Survey. But Edward&rsquo;s borough, the <i>Chronicle</i> tells us,
was on the south side of the Welland; the northern
borough, on the other side, may have been the work of
the Danes, as Stamford was one of the towns of the
Danish confederacy of the Five Boroughs. The
Norman castle and its motte are on the north side, and
five <i>mansiones</i> were destroyed for the site.<a name="FNanchor_691" id="FNanchor_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a> There is at
present no appearance of masonry on the motte, which
is partly cut away, and what remains of the castle wall
is of the 13th century. It is therefore probable that the
<i>turris</i>, or keep, which surrendered to Henry II. in 1153,
was of wood.<a name="FNanchor_692" id="FNanchor_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a> Henry gave the castle to Richard
Humet, constable of Normandy, in 1155.<a name="FNanchor_693" id="FNanchor_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a> It was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
very exceptional thing that Henry should thus alienate
a royal castle, and special circumstances must have
moved him to this act. The castle was destroyed in
Richard III.&rsquo;s time, and the materials given to the
convent of the Carmelite Friars. It appears to have
been within the town walls, with a bailey stretching
down to the river; this bailey is quadrangular. An
inquisition of 1341 states that &ldquo;the site of the castle
contains 2 acres.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_694" id="FNanchor_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a></p>

<p>Stamford had risen enormously in value since the
Conquest. &ldquo;In King Edward&rsquo;s time it paid 15<i>l.</i>; now,
it pays for <i>feorm</i> 50<i>l.</i>, and for the whole of the king&rsquo;s
dues it now pays 28<i>l.</i>&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_695" id="FNanchor_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stanton</span>, Stanton Long, in Shropshire (<a href="#Fig_32">Fig. 32</a>).&mdash;At
the time of the Survey, the Norman Helgot was Lord
of Corve Dale, and had his castle at Stanton.<a name="FNanchor_696" id="FNanchor_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a> The
castle was afterwards known as Helgot&rsquo;s Castle, corrupted
into Castle Holdgate. The site has been much altered
by the building of a farmhouse in the bailey, but the
motte still exists, high and steep, with a ditch round
about half its circumference; there are some traces of
masonry on the top. One side of the bailey ditch is
still visible, and a mural tower of Edwardian style has
been incorporated with the farmhouse. The exact area
cannot now be calculated, but it can hardly have
exceeded 2&frac12; acres. The manor of Stanton was an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
agglomeration of four small manors which had been
held by different proprietors in Saxon times, so it was
not the centre of a soke. The value of the manor had
risen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tamworth</span>, Stafford (<a href="#Fig_32">Fig. 32</a>).&mdash;Although Tamworth
Castle is not mentioned in Domesday Book, it
must have been in existence in the 11th century, as a
charter of the Empress Matilda mentions that Robert
le Despenser, brother of Urso d&rsquo;Abetot, had formerly
held this castle;<a name="FNanchor_697" id="FNanchor_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a> now Urso d&rsquo;Abetot was a contemporary
of the Conqueror, and so must his brother
have been. Tamworth Castle stands on a motte 50 feet
high, and 100 feet in diameter across the top, according
to Mr Clark. It is an interesting instance of what is
commonly called a shell keep, with a stone tower; one
of the instances which suggest that the shell did not
belong to a different type of castle to the tower, but was
simply a ward wall, which probably at first enclosed a
wooden tower. The tower and wall (or chemise) are
probably late Norman, but the remarkable wing wall
(there is only one, instead of the usual two) which runs
down the motte is entirely of herring-bone work, and
<i>may</i> be as old as Henry I.&rsquo;s time.<a name="FNanchor_698" id="FNanchor_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a> A bailey court,
which cannot have been large, lay between the motte
and the river Tame, but its outline cannot now be
determined, owing to the encroachments of buildings.
Tamworth is about a mile from the great Roman road
known as Watling Street. We have already referred
to the fortification of the <i>burh</i> here by Ethelfleda;<a name="FNanchor_699" id="FNanchor_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
probably she only restored walls or banks which had
existed before round this ancient capital of Mercia.</p>

<p>The value of the manor of Tamworth is not given
in Domesday Book.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tickhill</span>, Yorks (<a href="#Fig_32">Fig. 32</a>).&mdash;The name Tickhill does
not occur in Domesday, but it is covered by that of
Dadesley, the manor in which this castle was built: a
name which appears to have gone out of use when the
<i>hill</i> was thrown up. There can be no doubt that it was
the castle of Roger de Busli, one of the most richly
endowed of William&rsquo;s tenants-in-chief, as it is mentioned
as such by Ordericus.<a name="FNanchor_700" id="FNanchor_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a> He calls it the castle of Blythe,
a name which it probably received because Blythe was
the most important place near, and Dadesley was so
insignificant. Florence of Worcester, when describing
the same events, calls the castle Tykehill. The remains
furnish an excellent specimen of the earthworks of this
class. The motte is 75 feet high, and its area on top
about 80 feet in diameter; about a third of it is natural,
the rest artificial. Only a slight trace remains of the
ditch separating it from the oval bailey, which covers
2 acres. The foundations of a decagonal tower, built
in the reign of Henry II., are still to be seen on the top.<a name="FNanchor_701" id="FNanchor_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a>
The bailey retains its banks on the scarp, surmounted
now by a stone curtain, which, along with the older part
of the gatehouse, is possibly of the time of Henry I.<a name="FNanchor_702" id="FNanchor_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a>
The outer ditch is about 30 feet broad, and is still full
of water in parts. On the counterscarp a portion of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
bank remains. This bank carried a wooden palisade
when the castle was besieged by Cromwell.<a name="FNanchor_703" id="FNanchor_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a> The site
is not naturally defensible; it is about three and a half
miles from the northern Roman road.</p>

<p>The value of the manor of Dadesley had risen at the
time of the Survey.<a name="FNanchor_704" id="FNanchor_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a> The stone buildings which once
stood in the bailey have been transformed into a modern
house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tonbridge</span>, Kent (<a href="#Fig_33">Fig. 33</a>).&mdash;This notable castle, the
first English seat of the powerful family who afterwards
took their name from Clare in Suffolk, is first mentioned
in 1088, when it was stormed by William Rufus and his
English subjects, who had adopted his cause against the
supporters of his brother Robert.<a name="FNanchor_705" id="FNanchor_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a> The castle was one
of great importance at several crises in English history;
but it began as a wooden keep on a motte, and the
stone shell which now crowns this motte cannot be
earlier than the 12th century, and judging by its
buttresses, is much later. The castle stands outside the
town of Tonbridge, separated from it by moats which
were fed from the river. The smaller bailey of 1&frac12; acres,
probably the original one, is square, with rounded
corners. The palatial gatehouse, of the 13th or 14th
century, is a marked feature of this castle. There
appears to have been only one wing wall down the
motte to the bailey, but a second one was not needed,
owing to the position of the motte with regard to the
river.</p>

<p>The value of the manor of Hadlow, in which
Tonbridge lay, was stationary at Domesday.<a name="FNanchor_706" id="FNanchor_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a> It
belonged to the see of Canterbury, and was held by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
Richard de Bienfaite, ancestor of the House of Clare,
as a tenant of the see.</p>

</div></div>
<div class="caption">Fig. 33.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Totnes</span>, Devonshire (<a href="#Fig_33">Fig. 33</a>).&mdash;The castle of
Totnes belonged to Judhael, one of King William&rsquo;s
men, who has been already mentioned under Barnstaple.
This castle is not noticed in Domesday Book, but its
existence in the 11th century is made certain by a
charter of Judhael&rsquo;s giving land <i>below his castle</i> to the
Benedictine priory which he had founded at Totnes:
a charter certainly of the Conqueror&rsquo;s reign, as it
contains a prayer for the health of King William.<a name="FNanchor_707" id="FNanchor_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a> The
site was an important one; Totnes had been one of the
boroughs of the <i>Burghal Hidage</i>; it was at the head of
a navigable river, and was the point where the ancient
Roman (?) road from Devonshire to Bath and the North
began its course.<a name="FNanchor_708" id="FNanchor_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a> The motte of the castle is very high
and precipitous, and has a shell on top, which is perfect
up to the battlements, and appears to be rather late
Norman. This keep is entered in a very unusual way,
by a flight of steps leading up from the bailey, deeply
sunk in the upper part into the face of the motte, so as
to form a highly defensible passage. Two wing walls
run down to the walls of the bailey. There is at present
no ditch between the motte and the bailey. The whole
area of the work is &frac34; acre. It stands in a very defensible
situation on a spur of hill overlooking the town, and lies
just outside the ancient walls.</p>

<p>The value of the town of Totnes had risen at
Domesday.<a name="FNanchor_709" id="FNanchor_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Tower of London.</span>&mdash;Here, as at Colchester,
there is no motte, because the original design was that
there should be a stone keep. Ordericus tells us that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
after the submission of London to William the Conqueror
he stayed for a few days in Barking while certain
fortifications in the city were being finished, to curb the
excitability of the huge and fierce population.<a name="FNanchor_710" id="FNanchor_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a> What
these fortifications were we shall never know, but we
may imagine they were earthworks of the usual Norman
kind.<a name="FNanchor_711" id="FNanchor_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a> Certainly the great keep familiarly known as the
White Tower was not built in a few days; it does not
appear to have been even begun till some eleven years
later, when Gundulf, a monk celebrated for his architectural
skill, was appointed to the see of Rochester.
Gundulf was the architect of the Tower,<a name="FNanchor_712" id="FNanchor_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a> and it must
therefore have been built during his episcopate, which
lasted from 1077-1108.<a name="FNanchor_713" id="FNanchor_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a> In 1097 we read that
&ldquo;many shires which owe works to London were greatly
oppressed in making the wall (weall) round the Tower.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_714" id="FNanchor_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a>
This does not necessarily mean a stone wall, but
probably it does, as Gundulf&rsquo;s tower can hardly have
been without a bank and palisade to its bailey.</p>

<p>As the Tower in its general plan represents the
type of keep which was the model for all succeeding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
stone keeps up to the end of the 12th century, it seems
appropriate here to give some description of its main
features. Its resemblance to the keep of Colchester,
which also was a work of William I.&rsquo;s reign, is very
striking.<a name="FNanchor_715" id="FNanchor_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a> Colchester is the larger of the two, but
the Tower exceeds in size all other English keeps,
measuring 118 × 98 feet at its base.<a name="FNanchor_716" id="FNanchor_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a> As it has
been altered or added to in every century, its details
are peculiarly difficult to trace, especially as the
ordinary visitor is not allowed to make a thorough
examination.<a name="FNanchor_717" id="FNanchor_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a> Thus much, however, is certain: neither
of the two present entrances on the ground floor is
original; the first entrance was on the first floor, some
25 feet above the ground, at the S.W. angle of the
south side, and has been transformed into a window.
There was no entrance to the basement, but it was
only reached by the grand staircase, which is enclosed
in a round turret at the N.E. angle. There were
two other stairs at the N.W. and S.W. angles, but
these only began on the first floor. The basement
is divided by a cross wall, which is carried up to
the third storey. There are at present three storeys
above the basement. The basement, which is now
vaulted in brick, was not originally vaulted at all,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
except the south-eastern chamber, under the crypt of
the chapel.</p>

<p>The first floor, like the basement, is divided into
three rooms, as, in addition to the usual cross wall, the
Tower has a branch cross wall to its eastern section,
which is carried up to the top. This floor was formerly
only lit by loopholes; Clark states that there were two
fireplaces in the east wall, but there is some doubt
about this. The S.E. room contained the crypt
of the chapel, which was vaulted. It is commonly
supposed that the rooms on the first floor were
occupied by the guards of the keep. In the account
which we have quoted from Lambert of Ardres, the
first floor is said to be the lord&rsquo;s habitation, and
the upper storey that of the guards; so that there
seems to have been no invariable rule.<a name="FNanchor_718" id="FNanchor_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a> No special
room was allotted to the kitchen, as in time of
peace at any rate, the lord of the castle and all his
retainers took their meals in a great hall in the bailey
of the castle.<a name="FNanchor_719" id="FNanchor_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a> The ceilings of the two larger rooms
of this floor are now supported by posts, an arrangement
which is probably modern, as the present posts
certainly are.<a name="FNanchor_720" id="FNanchor_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a></p>

<p>The second floor contains the chapel, which in many
keeps is merely an oratory, but is here of unusual size.
Its eastern end is carried out in a round apse, a feature
which is also found at Colchester, but is not usual in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
Norman keeps.<a name="FNanchor_721" id="FNanchor_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a> It is a singularly fine specimen of an
early Norman chapel. This floor probably contained
the royal apartments; it was lighted by windows, not
loops. Both the eastern and western rooms had fireplaces;
the eastern room goes by the name of the
Banqueting Chamber.</p>

<p>The third storey is on a level with the triforium of
the chapel.<a name="FNanchor_722" id="FNanchor_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a> This triforium is continued all round the
keep as a mural passage, and it has windows only
slightly smaller than those of the floor below. These
mural galleries are found in most important keeps. As
their windows were of larger size than the loops which
lit the lower floors, it is possible that they may have
been used for defence, either for throwing down missiles
or for shooting with bows and arrows. But no near aim
could be taken without a downward splay to the window,
and the bows of the 11th and 12th centuries were
incapable of a long aim. A plausible theory is that
they were intended for the march of sentinels.<a name="FNanchor_723" id="FNanchor_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a></p>

<p>The masonry of the Tower is of Kentish rag, with
ashlar quoins. In mediæval times it had a forebuilding,
with a round stair turret, which is shown in some old
views; but it may reasonably be doubted whether this
was an original feature.</p>

<p>As regards the ground plan of the castle as a whole,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
it is now concentric, but was not so originally. The
Tower was certainly placed in the S.E. angle of the
Roman walls of London, and very near the east wall,
portions of which have been discovered.<a name="FNanchor_724" id="FNanchor_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a> The conversion
of the castle into one of the concentric type was the
work of later centuries, and the history of its development
has still to be traced.<a name="FNanchor_725" id="FNanchor_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trematon</span>, Cornwall (<a href="#Fig_34">Fig. 34</a>).&mdash;&ldquo;The Count [of
Mortain] has a castle there and a market, rendering 101
shillings.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_726" id="FNanchor_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a> Two Cornish castles are mentioned in
Domesday, and both of them are only on the borders
of that wild Keltic country; but while Launceston is
inland, Trematon guards an inlet on the south coast.
The position of this castle is extremely strong by nature,
at the end of a high headland; on the extreme point of
this promontory the motte is placed. It carries a well-preserved
shell wall, which may be of Norman date,
from the plain round arch of the entrance.<a name="FNanchor_727" id="FNanchor_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a> It has been
separated by a ditch from the bailey, but the steepness
of the hill rendered it unnecessary to carry this ditch all
round. The bailey, 1 acre in extent, in which a modern
house is situated, still has an entrance gate of the 13th
century, and part of a mediæval wall. A second bailey,
now a rose-garden, has been added at a later period.
In spite of the establishment of a castle and a market<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
the value of the manor of Trematon had gone down
at the time of the Survey, which may be accounted for
by the fact that there were only ten ploughs where there
ought to have been twenty-four. It was only a small
manor, and no burgus is mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tutbury</span>, Staffordshire (<a href="#Fig_34">Fig. 34</a>).&mdash;In the magnificent
earthworks of this castle, and the strength of its
site, we probably see a testimony to the ability of Hugh
d&rsquo;Avranches; for we learn from Ordericus that in 1070
William I. gave to Henry de Ferrers the castle of
Tutbury, which had belonged to Hugh d&rsquo;Avranches,<a name="FNanchor_728" id="FNanchor_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a>
to whom the king then gave the more dangerous but
more honourable post of the earldom of Chester.
Domesday Book simply states that Henry de Ferrers
has the castle of Tutbury, and that there are forty-two
men living by their merchandise alone in the borough
round the castle.<a name="FNanchor_729" id="FNanchor_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a></p>

<p>At Tutbury the keep was placed on an artificial
motte, which itself stood on a hill of natural rock,
defended on the N.W. side by precipices. There is no
trace of any ditch between the motte and bailey. At
present there is only the ruin of a comparatively modern
tower on the motte, but Shaw states that there was
formerly a stone keep.<a name="FNanchor_730" id="FNanchor_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a> A description of Elizabeth&rsquo;s
reign says, &ldquo;The castle is situated upon a round hill, and
is circumvironed with a strong wall of astilar [ashlar]
stone.... The king&rsquo;s lodging therein is fair and strong,
bounded and knit to the wall. And a fair stage hall of
timber, of a great length. Four chambers of timber,
and other houses well upholden, within the walls of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
castle.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_731" id="FNanchor_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a> The king&rsquo;s lodging will no doubt be the
closed gatehouse; the custom of erecting gatehouse
palaces arose as early as the 13th century. This account
shows how many of the castle buildings were still of
timber in Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign.</p>

<p>The bailey is quadrant-shaped, and has the motte at
its apex. Its area is 2&frac12; acres. Its most remarkable
feature is that it still retains its ancient banks on the
east side and part of the south, and the more recent
curtain is carried on top of them. This curtain is of the
same masonry as the three remaining towers, which are
of excellent Perpendicular work, and are generally
attributed to John of Gaunt, who held this castle after
his marriage with Blanche of Lancaster. The first
castle was undoubtedly of wood; it was pulled down
by order of Henry I. in 1175,<a name="FNanchor_732" id="FNanchor_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a> nor does there seem to
have been any resurrection till the time of Earl Thomas
of Lancaster at the earliest.</p>

<p>Though Tutbury was the centre of the Honour of
Ferrers, it does not seem to have been even a manor in
Saxon times. The borough was probably the creation
of the castellan, who also founded the Priory.<a name="FNanchor_733" id="FNanchor_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a> There is
no statement in the Survey from which we can learn the
value T. R. E., but T. R. W. it was 4<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i></p>

and probably never was one, as the situation is defended
by precipitous cliffs on all sides but one, where a deep
ditch has been cut across the neck of the headland.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wallingford</span>, Berkshire (<a href="#Fig_35">Fig. 35</a>).&mdash;There is good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
reason to suppose that in the <i>vallum</i> of the town of
Wallingford we have an interesting relic of Saxon
times. Wallingford is one of the boroughs enumerated
in the <i>Burghal Hidage</i>; it was undoubtedly a fortified
town at the time of the Conquest,<a name="FNanchor_735" id="FNanchor_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a> and is called a <i>burgus</i>
in Domesday Book; but there appears to be no evidence
to connect it with Roman times except the discovery of
a number of Roman coins in the town and its neighbourhood.
No Roman buildings or pavements have ever
been found.<a name="FNanchor_736" id="FNanchor_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a> The Saxon borough was built on the
model of a Roman <i>chester</i>: a square with rounded
corners. The rampart of Wallingford, which still exists
in great part, is entirely of earth, and must have been
crowned with a wooden wall, such as was still existing
at Portsmouth in Leland&rsquo;s time.<a name="FNanchor_737" id="FNanchor_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a> The accounts of
Wallingford in the great Survey are very full and
important. &ldquo;King Edward had eight virgates in the
borough of Wallingford, and in these there were 276
haughs paying 11<i>l.</i> of rent. Eight have been destroyed
for the castle.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_738" id="FNanchor_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a> This Norman castle was placed in the
N.E. corner of the borough. At present its precincts
cover 30 acres,<a name="FNanchor_739" id="FNanchor_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a> but this includes garden grounds, and
no doubt represents later enclosures. No ancient plan
of the castle has been preserved, but from Leland&rsquo;s
description there appear to have been three wards in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
time, each defended by banks and ditches. The inner
ward, which was doubtless the original one, is rudely
oblong in shape; it covers 4&frac12; acres. Leland says,
&ldquo;All the goodly buildings, with the towers and dungeon,
be within the third dyke.&rdquo; The motte, which still
exists, was on the south-eastern edge of this ward; that
is, it was so placed as to overlook both the borough and
the ford over the Thames.<a name="FNanchor_740" id="FNanchor_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a> It was ditched around,
and is said to have had a stone keep on the top; but
no foundations were found when it was recently
excavated. It was found to rest on a foundation of
solid masonry several feet thick, sloping upwards towards
the outside, so that it must have stood in a kind of
stone saucer.<a name="FNanchor_741" id="FNanchor_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a> The masonry which remains in the
other parts of the castle is evidently none of it of the
early Norman period, unless we accept a fragment of
wall which contains courses of tiles. Numerous buildings
were added in Henry III.&rsquo;s reign; the walls and
battlements were repaired, and the <i>hurdicium</i>, which
had been blown down by a high wind, was renewed.<a name="FNanchor_742" id="FNanchor_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a>
But the motte and the high banks show clearly that
the first Norman castle was of wood.</p>

<p>The value of the royal borough of Wallingford had
considerably risen since the Conquest.<a name="FNanchor_743" id="FNanchor_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warwick</span> (<a href="#Fig_36">Fig. 36</a>).&mdash;Here again we have a castle
built on land which the Conqueror obtained from a
Saxon convent, a positive proof that there was no castle
there previously. Only a small number of houses was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
destroyed for the castle,<a name="FNanchor_744" id="FNanchor_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a> and this points to the probability,
which is supported by some other evidence,
that the castle was built outside the town. Warwick, of
course, was one of the boroughs fortified by Ethelfleda,
and it was doubtless erected to protect the Roman road
from Bath to Lincoln, the Foss Way, against the Danes.
Domesday Book, after mentioning that the king&rsquo;s
barons have 112 houses in the borough, and the abbot
of Coventry 36, goes on to say that these houses
belong to the lands which the barons hold outside the
city, and are rated there.<a name="FNanchor_745" id="FNanchor_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a> This is one of the passages
from which Professor Maitland has concluded that the
boroughs planted by Ethelfleda and her brother were
organised on a system of military defence, whereby the
magnates in the country were bound to keep houses in
the towns.<a name="FNanchor_746" id="FNanchor_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a> Ordericus, after the well-known passage in
which he states that the lack of castles in England was
one great cause of its easy conquest by the Normans,
says: &ldquo;The king <i>therefore</i> founded a castle at Warwick,
and gave it in custody to Henry, son of Roger de
Beaumont.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_747" id="FNanchor_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a> Putting these various facts together, we
may fairly assert that the motte which still forms part
of the castle of Warwick was the work of the Conqueror,
and not, as Mr Freeman believed, &ldquo;a monument of
the wisdom and energy of the mighty daughter of
Alfred,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_748" id="FNanchor_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a> whose energy was very much better employed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
in the protection of her people. Dugdale, who also put
the motte down to Ethelfleda, was only copying Rous, a
very imaginative writer of the 15th century.</p>

<p>The motte of Warwick is mentioned several times in
the <i>Pipe Rolls</i> of Henry II.; it then carried wooden
structures on its top.<a name="FNanchor_749" id="FNanchor_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a> In Leland&rsquo;s time there were still
standing on this motte the ruins of a keep, which he
calls by its Norman name of the Dungeon. A fragment
of a polygonal shell wall still remains.<a name="FNanchor_750" id="FNanchor_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a> But there is not
a scrap of masonry of Norman date about the castle.
The motte, and the earthen bank which still runs along
one side of the court, show that the first castle was a
wooden one. The bailey is oblong in shape, the motte
being outside it; its area is about 2&frac12; acres.</p>

<p>The value of Warwick had doubled since the
Conquest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wigmore</span>, Herefordshire (<a href="#Fig_36">Fig. 36</a>).&mdash;We have
already referred to the absurdity of identifying
this place with the <i>Wigingamere</i> of the <i>Anglo-Saxon
Chronicle</i>.<a name="FNanchor_751" id="FNanchor_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a> We have the strongest indication that the
Norman castle at Wigmore was a new erection, since
Domesday Book tells us that William FitzOsbern
built it on waste land called Mereston.<a name="FNanchor_752" id="FNanchor_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a> This express
statement disposes of the fable in the <i>Fundationis
Historia</i> of Wigmore Priory, that the castle of
Wigmore had belonged to Edric the Wild, and was
rebuilt by Ralph Mortimer.<a name="FNanchor_753" id="FNanchor_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a> Wigmore had only been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
a small manor of two taxable hides in Saxon times.
Whereas it had then been unproductive, at the date of
the Survey there were two ploughs in the demesne, and
the borough attached to the castle yielded 7<i>l.</i> Here we
have another instance of the planting of a borough close
to a castle, and of the revenue which was thus obtained.</p>

<p>There is a very large and high motte at Wigmore
Castle, of oval shape, on a headland which has been cut
off by a deep ditch. The earthen banks of its first
fortification still remain, enclosing a small ward, but on
top of them is a wall in masonry, and the ruins of a
polygonal keep;<a name="FNanchor_754" id="FNanchor_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a> also the remains of two mural towers.
Half-way down the end of the headland, below the motte,
is a small square court, which <i>may</i> have been the
original bailey; below it, again, is a larger half-moon
bailey furnished with walls and towers. But the whole
area covered is only 1 acre. The masonry is none of
it earlier than the Decorated period, except one tower
in the bailey wall which may be late Norman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Winchester</span>, Hants.&mdash;We include Winchester
among the castles mentioned or alluded to in
Domesday Book, because we think it can be proved
that the <i>domus regis</i> mentioned under Alton and Clere
is the castle built by William outside the west gate of
the city, where the present County Hall is now almost
the only remaining relic of any castle at all.<a name="FNanchor_755" id="FNanchor_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a> Under
the head of &ldquo;Aulton&rdquo; we are told that the abbot of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
Hyde had unjustly gotten the manor in exchange for
the king&rsquo;s house, because by the testimony of the jurors
it was already the king&rsquo;s house.<a name="FNanchor_756" id="FNanchor_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a> That <i>excambio domus
regis</i> should read <i>excambio terræ domus regis</i> is clear
from the corresponding entry under Clere, where the
words are <i>pro excambio terræ in qua domus regis est in
civitate</i>.<a name="FNanchor_757" id="FNanchor_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a> The matter is put beyond a doubt by the
confirmatory charter of Henry I. to Hyde Abbey, where
the king states that his father gave Aulton and Clere to
Hyde Abbey <i>in exchange for the land on which he built
his hall in the city of Winchester</i>.<a name="FNanchor_758" id="FNanchor_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a> Where, then, was
this hall, which was clearly new, since fresh land was
obtained for it, and which must not therefore be sought
on the site of the palace of the Saxon kings? The
<i>Liber Winton</i>, a roll of Henry I.&rsquo;s time, says that twelve
burgesses&rsquo; houses had been destroyed and the land was
now occupied by the king&rsquo;s house.<a name="FNanchor_759" id="FNanchor_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a> Another passage
says that a whole street <i>outside the west gate</i> was
destroyed when the king made his ditch.<a name="FNanchor_760" id="FNanchor_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a> These
passages justify the conclusion of Mr Smirke that the
king&rsquo;s house at Winchester was neither more nor less
than the castle which existed until the 17th century
outside the west gate.<a name="FNanchor_761" id="FNanchor_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a> Probably the reason why it is
spoken of so frequently in the earliest documents as the
king&rsquo;s house or hall, instead of the castle, is that in this
important city, the ancient capital of Wessex, where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
king &ldquo;wore his crown&rdquo; once a year, William built,
besides the usual wooden keep on the motte, a stone
hall in the bailey, of size and dignity corresponding to
the new royalty.<a name="FNanchor_762" id="FNanchor_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a> In fact, the hall so magnificently
transformed by Henry III., and known to be the old
hall of the castle, can be seen on careful examination to
have still its original Norman walls and other traces of
early Norman work.<a name="FNanchor_763" id="FNanchor_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a> The palace of the Saxon kings
stood, where we might expect to find the palace of
native princes, in the middle of the city; according to
Milner it was on the site of the present Square.<a name="FNanchor_764" id="FNanchor_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a>
William may have repaired this palace, but that he
constructed two royal houses, a palace and a castle, is
highly improbable. The castle became the residence of
the Norman kings, and the Saxon palace appears to
have been neglected.<a name="FNanchor_765" id="FNanchor_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a> We see with what caution the
Conqueror placed his castle at the royal city of Wessex
without the walls. Milner tells us that there was no
access to it from the city without passing through the
west gate.<a name="FNanchor_766" id="FNanchor_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a> The motte of the castle appears to have
been standing in his time, as he speaks of &ldquo;the artificial
mount on which the keep stands.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_767" id="FNanchor_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a> It is frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
mentioned in mediæval documents as the <i>beumont</i> or
<i>beau mont</i>. It was surrounded by its own ditch.<a name="FNanchor_768" id="FNanchor_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a> The
bailey, if Speed&rsquo;s map is correct, was triangular in shape.
With its ditches and banks the castle covered 6 acres,
according to the commissioners who reported on it in
Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign; but the inner area cannot have been
more than 4&frac12; acres. We may infer from the sums
spent on this castle by Henry II., that he was the first
to give it walls and towers of stone; the <i>Pipe Rolls</i>
show entries to the amount of 1150<i>l.</i> during the course
of his reign; the work of the walls is frequently specified,
and stone is mentioned.</p>

<p>Domesday Book does not inform us whether the
value of Winchester had risen or fallen since the

that the castle occupied the whole half hide, which
might be some 60 acres; but it extinguished the
liability of that portion. At Windsor, however, we
have no occasion to press this argument as a proof that
the castle was new, since it is well established that the
palace of the Saxon kings was at least 2 miles from the
present castle and town, in the village long known as
Old Windsor, which fell into decay as the town of
Windsor sprang up under the Norman castle.<a name="FNanchor_770" id="FNanchor_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a> The
manor of Windsor was given by Edward the Confessor
to the convent of Westminster, but recovered by the
Conqueror.<a name="FNanchor_771" id="FNanchor_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a> But as the Survey shows us, he did not
build his castle in the manor of Windsor, but in that of
Clewer. He built it for a hunting-seat,<a name="FNanchor_772" id="FNanchor_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a> and it may
have been for the purpose of recovering forest rights
that he resumed possession of Old Windsor; but he
placed his castle in the situation which he thought best
for defence. For even a hunting-seat in Norman
times was virtually a castle, as many other instances
show.</p>

<p>It is needless to state that there is no masonry at
Windsor of the time of the Conqueror, or even of the
time of his son Henry I., in spite of the statement of
Stowe that Henry &ldquo;new builded the castle of Windsor.&rdquo;
This statement may perhaps be founded on a passage
in the <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i> which says that Henry
held his court for the first time in the New Windsor in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
1110. Perhaps the <i>Chronicle</i> here refers to the <i>borough</i>
of New Windsor, as an entry in the <i>Pipe Roll</i> of
Henry I. seems to show that he was the first to enclose
the <i>burgus</i> of Windsor.<a name="FNanchor_773" id="FNanchor_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a> For it is probable that the
first stone castle at Windsor was built by Henry II.,
who spent £1670 on it in the course of his reign. One
of his first acts after his accession was an exchange of
land at Windsor, which seems to have been for the
purpose of a vineyard, and was possibly the origin of
the second bailey.<a name="FNanchor_774" id="FNanchor_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a> At present the position of the
motte is central to the rest of the castle, but this is so
unusual that it suggests the idea that the upper ward
is the oldest, and that the motte stood on its outer edge.
Henry II. surrounded the castle with a wall, at a cost
of about 128<i>l.</i><a name="FNanchor_775" id="FNanchor_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a> The other entries in the <i>Pipe Rolls</i>
probably refer to the first stone shell on the motte, and
there is little doubt that the present Round Tower,
though its height has been raised in modern times, and
its masonry re-dressed and re-pointed so as to destroy
all appearance of antiquity, is in the main of Henry II.&rsquo;s
building. The frequent payments for stone show the
nature of Henry&rsquo;s work.</p>

<p>Although so much masonry was put up in Henry II.&rsquo;s
reign, the greater part of what is now visible is not
older than the time of Henry III. The lower bailey
seems to have been enlarged in his reign, as the castle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
ditch was extended towards the town, and compensation
given for houses taken down.<a name="FNanchor_776" id="FNanchor_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a> The upper (probably
the original) ward is rectangular in shape, and with the
motte and its ditches covers about 6&frac12; acres.<a name="FNanchor_777" id="FNanchor_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a> The state
apartments, a chapel, and the Hall of St George, are in
the upper ward, showing that this was the site of the
original hall and chapel of the castle. The charter of
agreement between Stephen and Henry in 1153 speaks
of the <i>motte</i> of Windsor as equivalent to the castle.<a name="FNanchor_778" id="FNanchor_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a>
Repairs of the motte are mentioned in the <i>Pipe Rolls</i> of
Henry II.<a name="FNanchor_779" id="FNanchor_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a></p>

<p>The value of the manor of Clewer had fallen since
the Conquest; that of Windsor, which was worth 15<i>l.</i>
T. R. E., but after the Conquest fell to 7<i>l.</i>, was again
worth 15<i>l.</i> at the date of the Survey.<a name="FNanchor_780" id="FNanchor_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wisbeach</span>, Cambridgeshire.&mdash;William I. built a
castle here in 1072, after suppressing the revolt of
Hereward, in order to hold in check the Cambridgeshire
fen country.<a name="FNanchor_781" id="FNanchor_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a> There is an early mention of it in the
Register of Thorney Abbey. This castle, after being
several times rebuilt, is now completely destroyed, and
&ldquo;several rows of elegant houses built on the site.&rdquo;
Nevertheless, there still remain distinct traces of the
motte-and-bailey pattern in the gardens which now
occupy the site of the original castle of King William;
the present Crescent probably follows the line of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
ditch. The meagre indications preserved in casual
accounts confirm this. There was an inner castle of
about 2 acres, just the area of the present garden
enclosure, and an outer court, probably an addition, of
some 4 acres.<a name="FNanchor_782" id="FNanchor_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a> Both areas were moated. Weston, a
prisoner who was confined in the keep of this castle in
the 17th century, has left an account of his captivity, in
which he casually mentions that the keep or dungeon
stood upon a high terrace, from which he could overlook
the outer bailey, and was surrounded by a moat filled
with water.<a name="FNanchor_783" id="FNanchor_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a></p>

<p>The castle is not mentioned in Domesday, but as
might be expected in a district which had been so
ravaged by war, the value of the manor had fallen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Worcester.</span>&mdash;This borough, as we have seen, was
fortified by Ethelfleda and her husband Ethelred in the
9th century. That the fortifications thus erected were
those of a city and not of a castle is shown with
sufficient clearness by the remarkable charter of this
remarkable pair, in which they declare that they have
built the <i>burh</i> at Worcester to shelter all the people,
and the churches, and the bishop.<a name="FNanchor_784" id="FNanchor_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a> The castle is first
mentioned in the <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i> in 1088, and
it is to be noted that it is styled the king&rsquo;s castle. Urse
d&rsquo;Abitot, the Norman sheriff of Worcester, has the
credit of having built the first castle, and Malmesbury
relates that he seized part of the monks&rsquo; cemetery for
the bailey.<a name="FNanchor_785" id="FNanchor_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a> The monks, however, held on to their right,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
and in the first year of Henry III. the bailey was
restored to them by the guardians of the young king,
the motte being reserved for the king&rsquo;s use.<a name="FNanchor_786" id="FNanchor_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a> The first
wooden castle was burnt in 1113.<a name="FNanchor_787" id="FNanchor_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a> The tower or keep
which succeeded it, and which was repaired by Henry
II.,<a name="FNanchor_788" id="FNanchor_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a> may have been either of stone or wood; but in the
order of John, that the gateway of the castle, which is
of wood, is to be made of stone, we get a hint of the
gradual transformation of the castle from a wooden to a
stone fortress.<a name="FNanchor_789" id="FNanchor_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a></p>

<p>Worcester Castle was outside the town, from
Speed&rsquo;s map, and was near the Severn. The area now
called College Green was no doubt the outer ward of
the castle, which was restored to the convent by Henry
III. The tower called Edgar&rsquo;s Tower was built by the
monks as the gatehouse to their newly conceded close.<a name="FNanchor_790" id="FNanchor_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a>
From the map given by Green, this outer bailey appears
to have been roughly square; but there was also a small
oblong inner ward, retained by the king, where the gaol
was afterwards built. The area of the castle is said
to have been between 3 and 4 acres.<a name="FNanchor_791" id="FNanchor_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a> The motte,
which is mentioned several times in mediæval docu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>ments,<a name="FNanchor_792" id="FNanchor_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a>
was completely levelled in 1848; it was then
found out that it had been thrown up over some
previous buildings, which were believed to be Roman,
though this seems doubtful.<a name="FNanchor_793" id="FNanchor_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a></p>

<p>The value of Worcester had risen since the
Conquest.<a name="FNanchor_794" id="FNanchor_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">York</span> (<a href="#Fig_39">Fig. 39</a>).&mdash;William the Conqueror built two
castles at York, and the mottes of both these castles
remain, one underneath Clifford&rsquo;s Tower, the keep of
York Castle, the other, on the south side of the Ouse,
still bearing the name of the Baile Hill, or the Old
Baile.<a name="FNanchor_795" id="FNanchor_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a> The <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i> implies, though it
does not directly state, that both these castles were
built in 1068, on the occasion of William&rsquo;s first visit to
York. The more detailed narrative of Ordericus shows
that one was built in 1068, and the other at the
beginning of 1069, on William&rsquo;s second visit.<a name="FNanchor_796" id="FNanchor_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a> Both
were destroyed in September 1069, when the English
and Danes captured York, and both were rebuilt before
Christmas of the same year, when William held his
triumphant Christmas feast at York.</p>

<p>This speedy erection, destruction, and re-erection is
enough to prove that the castles of William in York
were, like most other Norman castles, hills of earth with
buildings and stockades of wood, especially as we find
these hills of earth still remaining on the known sites of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
the castles. And we may be quite sure that the
Norman masonry, which Mr Freeman pictures as so
eagerly destroyed by the English, never existed.<a name="FNanchor_797" id="FNanchor_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a> But
the obstinate tendency of the human mind to make
things out older than they are has led to these earthen
hills being assigned to Britons, Romans, Saxons, Danes,
anybody rather than Normans. A single passage of
William of Malmesbury, in which he refers to the
<i>castrum</i> which the Danes had built at York in the
reign of Athelstan, is the sole vestige of basis for the
theory that the motte of Clifford&rsquo;s Tower is of Danish
origin.<a name="FNanchor_798" id="FNanchor_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a> The other theories have absolutely no foundation
but conjecture. If Malmesbury was quoting from
some older source which is now lost, it is extremely
probable that the word <i>castrum</i> which he copied, did
not mean a castle in our sense of the word at all, but
was a translation of the word <i>burh</i>, which almost
certainly referred to a vallum or wall constructed round
the Danish suburb outside the walls of York. Such a
suburb there was, for there in 1055 stood the Danish
church of St Olave, in which Earl Siward was buried,
and the suburb was long known as the Earlsburgh or
Earl&rsquo;s Burh, probably because it contained the residence
of the Danish earls of Northumbria.<a name="FNanchor_799" id="FNanchor_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a> This suburb<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
was not anywhere near Clifford&rsquo;s Tower, but in quite a
different part of the city. To prove that both the
mottes were on entirely new sites, we have the assurance
of Domesday Book that out of the seven <i>shires</i> or wards
into which the city was divided, one was laid waste for
the castles; so that there was clearly a great destruction
of houses to make room for the new castles.<a name="FNanchor_800" id="FNanchor_800"></a><a href="#Footnote_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a></p>

<p>What has been assumed above receives striking
confirmation from excavations made recently (1903) in
the motte of Clifford&rsquo;s Tower. At the depth of 13 feet
were found remains of a wooden structure, surmounted
by a quantity of charred wood.<a name="FNanchor_801" id="FNanchor_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a> Now the accounts of
the destruction of the castles in 1069 do not tell us that
they were burned, but thrown down and broken to
pieces.<a name="FNanchor_802" id="FNanchor_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a> But the keep which was restored by William,
and on the repair of which Henry II. spent 15<i>l.</i> in
1172,<a name="FNanchor_803" id="FNanchor_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a> was burnt down in the frightful massacre of the
Jews at York Castle in 1190.<a name="FNanchor_804" id="FNanchor_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a> The excavations disclosed
the interesting fact that this castle stood on a
lower motte than the present one, and that when the
burnt keep was replaced by a new one the motte was
raised to its present height, &ldquo;an outer crust of firmer
and more clayey material being made round the older<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
summit, and a lighter material placed inside this crater
to bring it up to the necessary level.&rdquo; This restoration
must have taken place in the third year of Richard I.,
when 28<i>l.</i> was spent &ldquo;on the work of the castle.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_805" id="FNanchor_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a>
This small sum shows that the new keep also was of
wood; and remains of timber work were in fact found
on the top of the motte during the excavations, though
unfortunately they were not sufficiently followed up to
determine whether they belonged to a wooden tower or
to a platform intended to consolidate the motte.<a name="FNanchor_806" id="FNanchor_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a> It is
extremely likely that this third keep was blown down by
the high wind of 1228, when 2s. was paid &ldquo;for collecting
the timber of York Castle blown down by the wind.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_807" id="FNanchor_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a>
In its place arose the present keep, one of the most
remarkable achievements of the reign of Henry III.<a name="FNanchor_808" id="FNanchor_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
The old ground-plan of the square Norman keep was
now abandoned, and replaced by a quatrefoil. The
work occupied thirteen years, from the 30th to
the 43rd Henry III., and the total sum expended
was 1927<i>l.</i> 8<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i>, equal to about 40,000<i>l.</i> of our
money. This remarkable fact has slumbered in the
unpublished <i>Pipe Rolls</i> for 700 years, never having
been unearthed by any of the numerous historians of
York.</p>

<p>The keep was probably the first work in stone at
York Castle, and for a long time it was probably the
only defensive masonry. The banks certainly had only
a wooden stockade in the early part of Henry III.&rsquo;s
reign, as timber from the forest of Galtres was ordered
for the repair of breaches in the <i>palicium</i> in 1225.<a name="FNanchor_809" id="FNanchor_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a> As
late as Edward II.&rsquo;s reign there was a <i>pelum</i>, or
stockade, round the keep, on top of a <i>murus</i>, which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
undoubtedly an earthen bank.<a name="FNanchor_810" id="FNanchor_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a> At present the keep
occupies the whole top of the motte except a small
<i>chemin de ronde</i>, but the fact so frequently alluded to in
the writs, that a stockade ran round the keep, proves
that a small courtyard existed there formerly, as was
usually the case with important keeps. Another writ of
Edward II.&rsquo;s reign shows that the motte was liable to
injury from the floods of the River Fosse,<a name="FNanchor_811" id="FNanchor_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a> and probably
its size has thus been reduced.</p>

<p>The present bailey of York Castle does not follow the
lines of the original one, but is an enlargement made in
1825. A plan made in 1750, and reproduced here,
shows that the motte was surrounded by its own ditch,
which is now filled up, and that the bailey, around
which a branch of the Fosse was carried, was of the
very common bean-shaped form; it was about 3 acres
in extent. The motte and bailey were both considerably
outside what is believed to have been the Anglo-Saxon
rampart of York,<a name="FNanchor_812" id="FNanchor_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a> but the motte was so placed as to
overlook the city.</p>

<p>The value of the city of York, in spite of the sieges
and sacks which it had undergone, and in spite of there
being 540 houses &ldquo;so empty that they pay nothing at
all,&rdquo; had risen at the date of the Survey from 53<i>l</i>. in
King Edward&rsquo;s time to 100<i>l.</i> in King William&rsquo;s.<a name="FNanchor_813" id="FNanchor_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a> This
extraordinary rise in value can only be attributed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
increased trade and increased exactions, the former
being promoted by the greater security given to the
roads by the castles, the latter due to the tolls on the
high-roads and waterways, which belonged to the king,
and the various &ldquo;customs&rdquo; belonging to the castles,
which, though new, were henceforth equally part of his
rights.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Baile Hill</span>, York (<a href="#Fig_39">Fig. 39</a>).&mdash;There can be
no doubt whatever that this still existing motte was the
site of one of William&rsquo;s castles at York, and it is even
probable that it was the older of the two, as Mr Cooper
conjectures from its position on the south side of the
river.<a name="FNanchor_814" id="FNanchor_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a> The castle bore the name of the Old Baile at
least as early as the 14th century, perhaps even in the
12th.<a name="FNanchor_815" id="FNanchor_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a> In 1326 a dispute arose between the citizens of
York and Archbishop William de Melton as to which
of them ought to repair the wall around the Old Baile.
The mayor alleged that the district was under the
express jurisdiction of the archbishop, exempt from that
of the city; the archbishop pleaded that it stood within
the ditches of the city.<a name="FNanchor_816" id="FNanchor_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a> The meaning of this dispute
can only be understood in the light of facts which have
recently been unearthed by the industry and observation
of Mr T. P. Cooper, of York.<a name="FNanchor_817" id="FNanchor_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a> The Old Baile, like so
many of William&rsquo;s castles, originally stood outside the
ramparts of the city. The original Roman walls of
York (it is believed) enclosed only a small space on the
eastern shore of the Ouse, and before the Norman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
Conquest the city had far outgrown these bounds, and
therefore had been enlarged in Anglo-Saxon times. It
appears that the Micklegate suburb was then for the
first time enclosed with a wall, and as this district is
spoken of in Domesday Book as &ldquo;the shire of the
archbishop,&rdquo; it was evidently under his jurisdiction.
At a later period this wall was buried in an earthen
bank, which probably carried a palisade on top, until the
palisade was replaced by stone walls in the reign of
Henry III.<a name="FNanchor_818" id="FNanchor_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a></p>

<p>The evidence of the actual remains renders it more
than probable that this rampart turned towards the
river at a point 500 feet short of its present angle, so that
the Old Baile, when first built, was quite outside the
city walls.<a name="FNanchor_819" id="FNanchor_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a> This is exactly how we should expect to
find a castle of William the Norman&rsquo;s in relation to one
of the most turbulent cities of the realm; and, as we
have seen, the other castle at York was similarly placed.
By the time of Archbishop Melton the south-western
suburb was already enclosed in the new stone walls
built in the 13th century, and these walls had been
carried along the west and south banks of the Old Baile,
so as to enclose that castle within the city. This was
the archbishop&rsquo;s pretext for trying to lay upon the
citizens the duty of maintaining the Old Baile. But
probably on account of his ancient authority in this part
of the city, the cause went against him; though he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
stipulated that whatever he did in the way of fortification
was of his own option, and was not to be accounted
a precedent. A contemporary chronicler says that he
enclosed the Old Baile first with stout planks 18 feet
long, afterwards with a stone wall:<a name="FNanchor_820" id="FNanchor_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a> an interesting proof
that wooden fortifications were still used in the reign of
Edward III.</p>

<p>Though the base court of the Old Baile is now built
over, its area and ditches were visible in Leland&rsquo;s time,<a name="FNanchor_821" id="FNanchor_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a>
and can still be guessed at by the indications Mr Cooper
has noted. The area of the bailey must have been
nearly 3 acres, and its shape nearly square. This
measurement includes the motte, which was placed in
the south-west corner on the line of the banks; it
thus overlooked the river as well as the city.<a name="FNanchor_822" id="FNanchor_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a></p>

<span class="smaller">MOTTE-CASTLES IN NORTH WALES</span></h2>

<p>Motte-castles are as common in Wales as they are in
England, and in certain districts much more common.
It is now our task to show how they got there. They
were certainly not built (in the first instance at any rate)
by the native inhabitants, for they do not correspond to
what we know to have been the state of society in Wales
during the Anglo-Saxon period.<a name="FNanchor_823" id="FNanchor_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a> The Welsh were then
in the tribal condition, a condition, as we have shown,
inconsistent with the existence of the private castle.
The residence of the king or chieftain, as we know
from the Welsh Laws, was a great hall, such as seems
to have been the type of chieftains&rsquo; residence among all
the northern nations at that time. &ldquo;It was adapted for
the joint occupation of a number of tribesmen living
together.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_824" id="FNanchor_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a></p>

<p>Pennant describes the residence of Ednowen, a
Welsh chieftain of the 12th century, as follows: &ldquo;The
remains are about 30 yards square; the entrance about
7 feet wide, with a large upright stone on each side for
a doorcase; the walls were formed of large stones
uncemented by any mortar; in short the structure shows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
the very low state of Welsh architecture at this time;
it may be paralleled only by the artless fabric of a
cattle-house.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_825" id="FNanchor_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a> This certainly is a hall and not a
castle.</p>

<p>The so-called Dimetian Code indeed tells us that the
king is to have a man and a horse from every hamlet,
with hatchets for constructing his castles (gestyll) at
the king&rsquo;s cost; but the Venedotian Code, which is the
older MS., says that these hatchet-men are to form
encampments (uuesten); that is, they are to cut down
trees and form either stockades on banks or rude <i>zerebas</i>
for the protection of the host.<a name="FNanchor_826" id="FNanchor_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a> It is clearly laid down
in the Codes what buildings the king&rsquo;s villeins are to
erect for him at his residences: a hall, buttery, kitchen,
dormitory, stable, dog-house, and little house.<a name="FNanchor_827" id="FNanchor_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a> In none
of these lists is anything mentioned which has the
smallest resemblance to a castle, not even a tower. We
can imagine that these buildings were enclosed in an
earthwork or stockade, but it is not mentioned.<a name="FNanchor_828" id="FNanchor_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a></p>

<p>Wales was never one state, except for very short
periods. Normally it was divided into three states,
Gwynedd or North Wales, Powys or Mid-Wales, and
Deheubarth, all almost incessantly at war with each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
other.<a name="FNanchor_829" id="FNanchor_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a> Other subdivisions asserted themselves as
opportunity offered, so that the above rough division
into provinces must not be regarded as always accurate.
A Wales thus divided, and perpetually rent by internal
conflicts, invited the aggression of the Saxons, and it
is probable that the complete subjugation of Britain
would have been accomplished by the descendants of
Alfred, if it had not been for the Danish invasions.
The position of the Welsh kings after the time of
Athelstan seems to have been that of tributaries, who
threw off their allegiance whenever it was possible to do
so. But still the Anglo-Saxon frontier continued to
advance. Professor Lloyd has shown, from a careful
examination of Domesday Book, that even before the
Norman Conquest the English held the greater part of
what is now Flintshire and East Denbighshire, and
were advancing into the vale of Montgomery and the
Radnor district.<a name="FNanchor_830" id="FNanchor_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a> The victories of Griffith ap Llywelyn,
an able prince who succeeded in bringing all Wales
under his sway, devastated these English colonies; but
his defeat by Earl Harold in 1063 restored the English
ascendancy over these regions. The unimpeachable
evidence of Domesday Book shows that a considerable
district in North Wales and a portion of Radnor were
held respectively by Earl Edwin and Earl Harold before
the Norman Conquest. Moreover, the fact mentioned
by the <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i> in 1065, that Harold was
building a hunting-seat for King Edward at Portskewet,
<i>after he had subdued it</i>, suggests that the land between
Wye and Usk, which Domesday Book reckons under
Gloucestershire, was a conquest of Harold&rsquo;s.<a name="FNanchor_831" id="FNanchor_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

<p>The Norman Conqueror was not the man to slacken
his hold on any territory which had been won by the
Saxons. But there is no succinct history of his
conquests in Wales; we have to make it out, in most
cases, from notices that are scarcely more than allusive,
and from the surer, though scanty, ground of documents.
It is noteworthy that the <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i> is so
hostile to the Norman kings that it discounts their
successes in Wales. Thus we have only the briefest
notice of William I.&rsquo;s invasion of South Wales, which
was very probably the beginning of the conquest of
that region; and several expeditions of William II. are
spoken of as entirely futile, though as we are told that the
existing castles were still held by the Normans, or new
ones were built, it is clear that this summing-up is not
strictly correct.<a name="FNanchor_832" id="FNanchor_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a> Our Welsh authorities, the <i>Annales
Cambriæ</i> and the <i>Brut y Tywysogion</i>,<a name="FNanchor_833" id="FNanchor_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a> seem to give a
fairly candid account of the period, although the dates
in the <i>Brut</i> are for the most part wrong (sometimes by
three years), and they hardly ever give us a view of the
situation as a whole. They tell us when the Welsh
rushed down and burnt the castles built by the Normans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
in the conquered districts, but do not always tell when
the Normans recovered and rebuilt them.</p>

<p>Fortunately we are not called upon here to trace the
history of the cruel and barbarous warfare between
Normans and Welsh. No one can turn that bloodstained
page without wishing that the final conquest
had come two hundred years earlier, to put an end
to the tragedy of suffering which must have been so
largely the portion of the dwellers in Wales and the
Marches after the coming of the Normans.<a name="FNanchor_834" id="FNanchor_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a> Our
business with both Welsh and Normans is purely
archæological. We hold no brief for the Normans, nor
does it matter to us whether they kept their hold on
Wales or were driven out by the Welsh; our concern
is with facts, and the solid facts with which we have
to deal are the castles whose remains still exist in
Wales, and whose significance we have to interpret.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wales was under his sway, and he built castles
therein,&rdquo; says the <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i>, in summing
up the reign of the Conqueror; a passage which is
scarcely consistent with its previous almost complete
silence about events in Wales. There can be little
doubt that William aimed at a complete conquest of
Wales, and that the policy he adopted was the creation
of great earldoms along the Welsh border, endowed with
special privileges, one of which was the right of conquering
whatever they could from the Welsh.<a name="FNanchor_835" id="FNanchor_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a> To these
earldoms he appointed some of his strongest men, men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
little troubled by scruples of justice or mercy, but
capable leaders in war or diplomacy. It was an essential
part of the plan that every conquest should be secured
by the building of castles, just as had been done in
England. And we have now to trace very briefly the
outline of Norman conquest in Wales by the castles
which they have left behind them.</p>

<p>We shall confine ourselves to those castles which are
mentioned in the <i>Brut y Tywysogion</i>, the <i>Pipe Rolls</i>, or
other trustworthy documents between 1066 and 1216,
the end of King John&rsquo;s reign. Of many of these castles
only the earthworks remain; of many others the original
plan, exactly similar to that of the early castles of
Normandy and France, is still to be traced, though masked
by the masonry of a later age. Grose remarked but
could not explain the fact that we continually read of
the castles of the Marches being burnt and utterly
destroyed, and a few months later we find them again
standing and in working order. This can only, but
easily, be explained when we understand that they were
wooden castles built on mottes, quickly restored after
a complete destruction of the wooden buildings.</p>

<p>North Wales appears to have been the earliest
conquest of the Normans, though not the most lasting.
North Wales comprised the Welsh kingdoms of
Gwynedd and Powys. Gwynedd covered the present
shires of Anglesea, Carnarvon, and Merioneth, and
the mountainous districts round Snowdon.<a name="FNanchor_836" id="FNanchor_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a> Powys
stretched from the estuary of the Dee to the upper
course of the Wye, and roughly included Flint, Denbigh,
Montgomery, and Radnor shires. Hugh of Avranches,
Earl of Chester, was the great instrument of Norman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
conquest in Gwynedd, and in the northern part of
Powys, which lay so near his own dominions. He was
evidently a man in whose ability William had great
confidence, as he removed him from Tutbury to the
more difficult and dangerous position of Chester, and
gave his earldom palatine privileges; all the land in
Cheshire was held under the earl, and he was a sort
of little king in his county.</p>

<p>Hugh appears to have at once commenced the
conquest of North Wales. As Professor Lloyd remarks,
Domesday Book shows us Deganwy as the most
advanced Norman post on the North Welsh coast,
while on the Bristol Channel they had got no further
than Caerleon.<a name="FNanchor_837" id="FNanchor_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a> In advancing to the valley of the
Clwyd and building a castle at Rhuddlan, the Normans
were only securing the district which had already been
conquered by Harold in 1063, when he burnt the hall
of King Griffith at Rhuddlan. Nearly the whole of
Flintshire (its manors are enumerated by Domesday
Book under Cheshire) was held by Earl Hugh in 1086,
so that he commanded the entire road from Chester to
Rhuddlan. His powerful vassal, Robert of Rhuddlan,
who became the terror of North Wales, besides the
lands which he held of Earl Hugh, held also directly
of the King Rhos and Rhufeniog, districts which
roughly correspond to the modern shire of Denbigh,
and &ldquo;Nort Wales&rdquo; which Professor Lloyd takes to
mean the remainder of the principality of Gwynedd,
from which the rightful ruler, Griffith ap Cynan, had
been driven as an exile to Ireland.</p>

<p>It does not appear that there was any fortification
at <span class="smcap">Rhuddlan</span><a name="FNanchor_838" id="FNanchor_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a> before the &ldquo;castle newly erected&rdquo; by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
Earl Hugh and his vassal Robert. They shared
between them the castle and the <i>new borough</i> which was
built near it.<a name="FNanchor_839" id="FNanchor_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a> One word about this new borough,
which will apply to the other boroughs planted by
Norman castles. There were no towns in Wales of
any importance before the Norman Conquest, and this
civilising institution of the borough is the one great
set-off to the cruelty and unrighteousness of the
conquest. Mills, markets, and trade arose where castles
were seated, and civilisation followed in their train.</p>

<p>The castle of Hugh and Robert was not the
magnificent building which still stands at Rhuddlan,
for that is entirely the work of Edward I., and there
is documentary evidence that Edward made a purchase
of new land for the site of his castle.<a name="FNanchor_840" id="FNanchor_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a> More probably
Robert and Hugh had a wooden castle on the now
reduced motte which may be seen to the south of
Edward&rsquo;s castle. In Gough&rsquo;s time this motte was still
&ldquo;surrounded with a very deep ditch, including the
abbey.&rdquo; Nothing can be seen of this ditch now, except
on the south side of the motte, where a deep ravine runs
up from the river. As from Gough&rsquo;s description the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
hillock (called Tut Hill)<a name="FNanchor_841" id="FNanchor_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a> was within the precincts of
the priory of Black Friars, founded in the 13th century,
it is extremely probable that Edward gave the site of the
old castle to the Dominicans when he built his new one.<a name="FNanchor_842" id="FNanchor_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a></p>

<p>Another of the castles of Robert of Rhuddlan was
<span class="smcap">Deganwy</span>, or Gannoc, which defended the mouth of the
Conway.<a name="FNanchor_843" id="FNanchor_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a> Here it is said that there was an ancient
seat of the kings of Gwynedd.<a name="FNanchor_844" id="FNanchor_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a> The two conical hills
which rise here offer an excellent site for fortification,
one of them being large enough on top for a considerable
camp. The Norman Conqueror treated them as
two mottes, and connected them by walls so as to form
a bailey below them. The stone fortifications are
probably the remains of the castle built by the Earl of
Chester in 1211.<a name="FNanchor_845" id="FNanchor_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_845" class="fnanchor">[845]</a> This castle was naturally a sorely
contested point, and often passed from hand to hand;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
but it was in English possession in the reign of Henry
III. It was abandoned when Edward I. built his great
castle at Conway.</p>

<p>With its usual indifference, the Survey mentions no
castle in Flintshire, but we may be sure that the castle
of <span class="smcap">Mold</span>, or Montalto (<a href="#Fig_40">Fig. 40</a>), was one of the earliest
by which the Norman acquisitions in that region were
defended,<a name="FNanchor_846" id="FNanchor_846"></a><a href="#Footnote_846" class="fnanchor">[846]</a> though it is not mentioned in authentic
history until 1147. The tradition that it was built by
Robert de Monte Alto, one of the barons of the Earl of
Chester, is no doubt correct, though the assumption of
Welsh legend-makers that the <i>Gwydd Grug</i>, or great
tumulus, from which this castle derives its Welsh name,
existed before the castle, may be dismissed as baseless.
The motte of Robert de Monte Alto still exists, and is
uncommonly high and perfect; it has two baileys, separated
by great ditches, and appears to have had a shell on
top. [D. H. M.] The castle was regarded as specially
strong, and its reduction by Owen Gwynedd in 1147 was
one of the sweetest triumphs that the Welsh ever won.<a name="FNanchor_847" id="FNanchor_847"></a><a href="#Footnote_847" class="fnanchor">[847]</a></p>

<p>It is clear from the <i>Life of Griffith ap Cynan</i><a name="FNanchor_848" id="FNanchor_848"></a><a href="#Footnote_848" class="fnanchor">[848]</a> that
the Earl of Chester had conquered and incastellated
Gwynedd before the accession of William Rufus. This
valuable document unfortunately gives no dates, but it
mentions in particular the castle at Aberlleinog,<a name="FNanchor_849" id="FNanchor_849"></a><a href="#Footnote_849" class="fnanchor">[849]</a> one at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
Carnarvon, one at Bangor, and one in Merioneth. The
motte at <span class="smcap">Aberlleinog</span>, near Beaumaris, still exists, and
the half-moon bailey is traceable, but the curious little
round towers and revetting wall in masonry on the
motte were probably built to carry guns at the time of
the Civil War, when this castle was besieged by the
Royalists. At <span class="smcap">Carnarvon</span> the magnificent castle of
Edward I. has displaced all former erections, yet some
evidence for a motte-and-bailey plan may be found in
the fact that the northern portion of the castle has evidently
been once separated by a ditch from the southern,
and is also much higher.<a name="FNanchor_850" id="FNanchor_850"></a><a href="#Footnote_850" class="fnanchor">[850]</a> On the hills above <span class="smcap">Bangor</span>,
Pennant thought he had discovered the remains of Earl
Hugh&rsquo;s castle, but having carefully examined these
walls, we are convinced that they never formed part of a
castle at all, as they are much too thin; nor are there
any vestiges of earthworks.<a name="FNanchor_851" id="FNanchor_851"></a><a href="#Footnote_851" class="fnanchor">[851]</a> We are disposed to think
that instead of at Bangor, the castle of Earl Hugh
was at <span class="smcap">Aber</span>, often spoken of as <span class="smcap">Abermenai</span> in the
<i>Chronicles</i>, and evidently the most important port on
the Straits. At Aber there still remains a motte which
must have belonged to an important castle, as it was
afterwards one of the seats of Llywelyn ap Jorwerth,
Prince of Gwynedd. The castle in Merioneth cannot be
certainly identified.</p>

<p>In one of the invasions of William Rufus, which
both the <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i> and the <i>Brut</i> describe
as so unsuccessful, we hear that he encamped at <span class="smcap">Mur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
Castell</span>, a place undoubtedly the same as what is now
called <span class="smcap">Tomen-y-Mur</span>, a motte standing just inside a
Roman camp, on the Roman road leading from Shropshire
into Merioneth and Carnarvon. This motte is
surrounded by a ditch; there are traces of the usual
earthen rampart round the top, now mutilated by landslips.<a name="FNanchor_852" id="FNanchor_852"></a><a href="#Footnote_852" class="fnanchor">[852]</a>
We may, with great probability, assume that
this motte was thrown up by William Rufus, and that
the Roman camp served as a bailey for his invading
host. Whether it was garrisoned for the Normans we
cannot say, but it evidently formed an important post on
a route often followed by their invading armies, as
Henry I. is said to have encamped there twice.<a name="FNanchor_853" id="FNanchor_853"></a><a href="#Footnote_853" class="fnanchor">[853]</a> It is
one of the few mottes which stand in a wild and
mountainous situation, and its purpose no doubt was
purely military.<a name="FNanchor_854" id="FNanchor_854"></a><a href="#Footnote_854" class="fnanchor">[854]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The earls of Chester did not retain the sovereignty
of Gwynedd; on the death of Rufus, Griffith ap Cynan
returned, and obtained possession of Anglesea. He
was favourably received at the court of Henry I., and
gradually recovered possession of the whole of Gwynedd.
In 1114 Henry had to undertake a great expedition
against him to enforce the payment of tribute;<a name="FNanchor_855" id="FNanchor_855"></a><a href="#Footnote_855" class="fnanchor">[855]</a> from
which, and from the peaceful manner in which Griffith
seems to have acquired his principality, we may infer that
this tribute was the bargain of his possession. It very
likely suited Henry&rsquo;s policy better to have a tributary
Welsh prince than a too powerful earl of Chester.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>

<p>The reigns of the three first Norman kings were the
time in which Norman supremacy in Wales made its
greatest advances. With the accession of Stephen and
the civil war which followed it came the great opportunity
for the Welsh of throwing off the Norman yoke.
Powys appears to have been the only province which
remained faithful to the English allegiance, under Madoc
ap Meredith.<a name="FNanchor_856" id="FNanchor_856"></a><a href="#Footnote_856" class="fnanchor">[856]</a> The history of Norman conquest in
Powys is more confused than that of Gwynedd, but
Domesday shows us that Rainald, the Sheriff of Shropshire,
a vassal of Earl Roger of Shrewsbury, was seated
at Edeyrnion and Cynlle, two districts along the upper
valley of the Dee.<a name="FNanchor_857" id="FNanchor_857"></a><a href="#Footnote_857" class="fnanchor">[857]</a> Robert of Rhuddlan held part of
his grant of &ldquo;Nort Wales,&rdquo; namely the hundred of
Arwystli, in the very centre of Wales, under Earl Roger.
Professor Lloyd remarks, &ldquo;Earl Roger claimed the
same authority over Powys as Earl Hugh over Gwynedd,
and the theory that the princes of this region were
subject to the lords of Salop survived the fall of the
House of Montgomery.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_858" id="FNanchor_858"></a><a href="#Footnote_858" class="fnanchor">[858]</a></p>

<p>We have already spoken of Earl Roger de Montgomeri
and his brood of able and unscrupulous sons.<a name="FNanchor_859" id="FNanchor_859"></a><a href="#Footnote_859" class="fnanchor">[859]</a>
The palatine earldom of Shrewsbury lay along the
eastern border of central Powys, and must soon have
proved a menace to that Welsh kingdom. Domesday
Book shows us that Earl Roger had already planted his
castle of Montgomery well within the Welsh border at
that date. But the ambition of Earl Roger and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
sons stretched beyond their immediate borders. It is
probable that they used the upper Severn valley, which
they fortified by the castle of Montgomery, and possibly
by the castle of Welshpool, as their road into Ceredigion,
for we find Earl Roger named by the <i>Brut</i> as the builder
of the castle of Cilgerran,<a name="FNanchor_860" id="FNanchor_860"></a><a href="#Footnote_860" class="fnanchor">[860]</a> and some say of Cardigan
also. Possibly he was helping his son Arnolf in the
conquest of Pembroke. In 1098 we find his successor,
Earl Hugh, allied with the Earl of Chester in the
invasion of Anglesea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Montgomery.</span>&mdash;This castle is named from the
ancestral seat of its founder.<a name="FNanchor_861" id="FNanchor_861"></a><a href="#Footnote_861" class="fnanchor">[861]</a> The motte-and-bailey
plan is still very apparent in the ruins, though the motte
is represented by a precipitous rock, only a few feet
higher than the baileys attached, and separated from them
by a ditch cut through the headland. The masonry,
the chief part of which is the shell wall and towers on
this isolated rock, is none of it older than the reign of
Henry III., when large sums were spent on this castle,
and it is spoken of in a writ as &ldquo;the new Castle of
Montgomery.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_862" id="FNanchor_862"></a><a href="#Footnote_862" class="fnanchor">[862]</a> Yet even then the whole of the
defences were not remade in stone, as bretasches of
timber are ordered in a <i>mandamus</i> of 1223.<a name="FNanchor_863" id="FNanchor_863"></a><a href="#Footnote_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a> The four
wards are all roughly rectilateral. The castle was never
recovered permanently by the Welsh, and after the
forfeiture of Robert Belesme, the third Earl of Shrewsbury,
in 1101, the Crown kept this important border
fortress in its own hands throughout the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>Although Montgomery Castle is the only one
mentioned in that region at the same date, there must
have been many others, for in 1225 Henry III. ordered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
all who had mottes in the valley of Montgomery to
fortify them with good bretasches without delay;<a name="FNanchor_864" id="FNanchor_864"></a><a href="#Footnote_864" class="fnanchor">[864]</a> and
the remains of these mottes are still numerous in the
valley. It is quite possible that the mottes at Moat
Lane and Llandinam were thrown up to defend the road
into Arwystli; but this is conjecture.<a name="FNanchor_865" id="FNanchor_865"></a><a href="#Footnote_865" class="fnanchor">[865]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Welshpool</span>, <i>alias</i> Pol or Pool (<a href="#Fig_40">Fig. 40</a>), is also called
the Castle of Trallung.&mdash;In Powell&rsquo;s <i>History of Wales</i>
(p. 137) it is stated that Cadwgan ap Bleddyn, when
Henry I. took Cardigan from him, retired to Powys, and
began to build a castle here. Powell&rsquo;s statements,
however, have no authority when unconfirmed, and we
are unable to find any confirmation of this statement in
the more trustworthy version of the <i>Brut</i>. And as the
House of Montgomeri was firmly established in the valley
of Montgomery as early as 1086, it seems more probable
that the two motte-and-bailey castles at Welshpool,
lower down the Severn valley, are relics of the early
progress of that family, especially as one of these castles
is only about a mile east of Offa&rsquo;s Dyke, the ancient
border. This latter motte is partly cut into by the
railway, and diminished in size, but the bailey is nearly
perfect. The other one is in the park of Powys Castle,
and is an admirable specimen of its class. The breastwork
round the top of the motte remains. [H. W.] It
seems probable that this was the precursor of Powys
Castle, and was abandoned at an early period, as the
newer castle was known by the name of Castell Coch, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
the Red Castle, as early as 1233.<a name="FNanchor_866" id="FNanchor_866"></a><a href="#Footnote_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a> Leland states that
there were formerly two castles of two different Lords
Marchers at Welshpool;<a name="FNanchor_867" id="FNanchor_867"></a><a href="#Footnote_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a> possibly this throws some
light on the existence of these two motte-castles.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When Henry II. came to the throne in 1154, one of
the many questions which he had to settle was the
Welsh question. His first expedition against North
Wales was in 1157. Here he was one day placed in
grave difficulties, and fortune was only restored by his
personal courage. But in spite of this we learn even
from the Welsh chronicler that he continued his advance
to Rhuddlan, and that the object of the expedition,
which was the restoration of Cadwalader, one of the
sons of Griffith ap Cynan, to his lands, was accomplished.
The English chronicler Roger of Wendover
says that Henry recovered all the fortresses which had
been taken from his predecessors, and rebuilt Basingwerk
Castle; and when he had reduced the Welsh to
submission, returned in triumph to England. The
undoubted facts of the <i>Pipe Rolls</i> show us that in the
year 1159 Henry had in his hands the castles of
Overton, Hodesley, Wrexham, Dernio, Ruthin, and
Rhuddlan, castles which would give him command of
the whole of Flintshire and of East Denbigh and the
valley of the Clwyd. Similarly, after the expedition of
1165, sometimes stated to have been only disastrous, we
find him in possession of the castles of Rhuddlan,
Basingwerk, Prestatyn, Mold, Overton, and Chirk;<a name="FNanchor_868" id="FNanchor_868"></a><a href="#Footnote_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a> so
that after the battle of Crogen, or Chirk, he actually
held the battlefield.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>

<p>We are thus introduced to an entirely new group of
castles, Rhuddlan being the only one which we have
heard of before. But it is highly probable that most of
these castles were originally raised by the earls of
Chester or Shrewsbury, and were in Henry&rsquo;s hands by
escheat.</p>

<p>*<span class="smcap">Basingwerk.</span>&mdash;The <i>werk</i> referred to in this name
has probably nothing to do with the castle, but refers to
Wat&rsquo;s Dyke, which reaches the Dee at this point. The
abbey at this place was founded by an earl of Chester,<a name="FNanchor_869" id="FNanchor_869"></a><a href="#Footnote_869" class="fnanchor">[869]</a>
which makes it probable that the castle also was originally
his work, especially as Wendover says that Henry
<i>rebuilt</i> it. There is no trace of a castle near the
abbey,<a name="FNanchor_870" id="FNanchor_870"></a><a href="#Footnote_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a> but less than a mile off, near Holywell Church,
there is a headland called Bryn y Castell, with a small
mound at the farther end, which has far more claim to
be the site of Basingwerk Castle, especially as it is
mentioned in John&rsquo;s reign (when it was retaken from
the Welsh) as the castle of Haliwell.<a name="FNanchor_871" id="FNanchor_871"></a><a href="#Footnote_871" class="fnanchor">[871]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Overton</span>, in East Denbigh, on the middle course of
the Dee. In custody of Roger de Powys for the king
in 1159-1160. As Leland speaks of the ditches and hill
of the castle, it was probably a motte-castle of the usual
type. &ldquo;One parte of the ditches and Hille of the castel
yet remaynith; the residew is in the botom of Dee.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_872" id="FNanchor_872"></a><a href="#Footnote_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a>
It is probably all there now, as not a vestige can be
traced. [B. T. S.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dernio</span>, or Dernant.&mdash;There can be no question that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
Dernio is Edeyrnion, the valley stretching from Bala
Lake to Corwen. Domesday Book tells us that Rainald
the Sheriff, a &ldquo;man&rdquo; of Earl Roger of Shrewsbury, held
two &ldquo;fines&rdquo; in Wales, Chenlei and Dernio, that is,
Cynllaith and Edeyrnion.<a name="FNanchor_873" id="FNanchor_873"></a><a href="#Footnote_873" class="fnanchor">[873]</a> Towards the end of the
11th century there must have been a Norman castle at
Rug in Edeyrnion, as it was to this place that the earls
of Chester and Shrewsbury enticed Griffith ap Cynan,
the rightful ruler of Gwynedd; they then sent him
prisoner to Chester for twelve years.<a name="FNanchor_874" id="FNanchor_874"></a><a href="#Footnote_874" class="fnanchor">[874]</a> Very likely the
castle of Dernio, which Henry II. was putting into a
state of defence in 1159,<a name="FNanchor_875" id="FNanchor_875"></a><a href="#Footnote_875" class="fnanchor">[875]</a> was at <span class="smcap">Rug</span>, 1&frac12; miles from
Corwen, where there is still a motte in some private
grounds, and there was formerly a bailey also.<a name="FNanchor_876" id="FNanchor_876"></a><a href="#Footnote_876" class="fnanchor">[876]</a> The
place was the seat of an important family in later times.
At any rate, the castle was in Edeyrnion, and shows that
Henry was holding the northern part of Merionethshire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hodesley</span>; undoubtedly &ldquo;The Rofts&rdquo; near Gresford,
a motte with remains of a bailey, on a headland
above the river Alyn. It is in the former lordship of
Hoseley.<a name="FNanchor_877" id="FNanchor_877"></a><a href="#Footnote_877" class="fnanchor">[877]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wrexham</span>, the Wristlesham of the <i>Pipe Rolls</i> (<a href="#Fig_40">Fig.
40</a>).&mdash;Henry was paying for the custody of this castle
and that of Hoseley in 1160 and 1161. Both castles are
in the district of Bromfield, which was one of the early
acquisitions of the earls of Chester. Mr Palmer remarks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
that this district was probably ceded to the princes of
Powys, in return for the help which they often rendered
to the English king against other Welsh princes, as it
is found as part of Powys at a later period.<a name="FNanchor_878" id="FNanchor_878"></a><a href="#Footnote_878" class="fnanchor">[878]</a> There are
no remains of any castle at Wrexham itself, but about a
mile off, in Erddig Park, there is a motte and bailey of
considerable size (though the motte is reduced) showing
that a castle of some importance once stood there.
There were formerly some remains of masonry.<a name="FNanchor_879" id="FNanchor_879"></a><a href="#Footnote_879" class="fnanchor">[879]</a> Wat&rsquo;s
Dyke has been utilised to form one side of the bailey.
It is probable that the importance of the two Bromfield
castles, Wrexham and Hoseley, was lost when the
princes of Powys built their castle on Dinas Bran.</p>

<p>*<span class="smcap">Ruthin.</span>&mdash;This important castle, defending the
upper valley of the Clwyd, was probably in existence
long before Henry II. repaired it in 1160, and may
perhaps be attributed to Earl Hugh of Chester. The
plan shows distinctly that it was once a motte and bailey,
though the castle is now transformed into a modern
house.<a name="FNanchor_880" id="FNanchor_880"></a><a href="#Footnote_880" class="fnanchor">[880]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chirk</span>, or Crogen, in the valley of the Ceiriog.&mdash;Henry
was paying for the custody of this castle in 1164,
and was provisioning it in 1167.<a name="FNanchor_881" id="FNanchor_881"></a><a href="#Footnote_881" class="fnanchor">[881]</a> King John paid for
the erection of a bretasche there, possibly after some
destruction by the Welsh.<a name="FNanchor_882" id="FNanchor_882"></a><a href="#Footnote_882" class="fnanchor">[882]</a> Probably the first castle of
Chirk did not stand in the commanding situation now
occupied by the castle of Edward I.&rsquo;s reign, but is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
represented by a small motte in a garden near the
Ceiriog stream, and close to the church. An Anglo-Norman
poem of the 13th century attributes the first
building of this castle to William Peverel, Lord of
Whittington and Ellesmere, and says he placed it &ldquo;on
the water of Ceiriog.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_883" id="FNanchor_883"></a><a href="#Footnote_883" class="fnanchor">[883]</a> No doubt it defended the
passage of the stream, and an important road into
Shropshire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prestatyn.</span>&mdash;This castle defended the coast road
from Chester to Rhuddlan. Henry II. granted it to
Robert Banaster for his services in 1165.<a name="FNanchor_884" id="FNanchor_884"></a><a href="#Footnote_884" class="fnanchor">[884]</a> It was
destroyed by Owen Gwynedd in 1167, and does not
appear to have been rebuilt. A low motte with a half-moon
bailey, and a larger square enclosure, still remain.
[B. T. S.]</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr Davis has remarked that John was more successful
in extending his authority over the British Isles than
in anything else.<a name="FNanchor_885" id="FNanchor_885"></a><a href="#Footnote_885" class="fnanchor">[885]</a> In 1211 he led an expedition into the
heart of Wales, and reduced his son-in-law Llywelyn ap
Jorwerth to complete submission. As usual, the
expedition was marked by the building or repair of
castles. The Earl of Chester restored Deganwy,
which shows that the English frontier was again
advanced to the Conway; he also repaired the castle
of Holywell, which the <i>Pipe Roll</i> shows to have been
recovered from the Welsh about this time.<a name="FNanchor_886" id="FNanchor_886"></a><a href="#Footnote_886" class="fnanchor">[886]</a> These <i>Rolls</i>
also show that in 1212-1213 John was paying for works at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
the castles of Carreghova, Ruthin, and Chirk, as well as
at the following castles, which have not been mentioned
before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mathraval</span>, Madrael in the <i>Pipe Rolls</i> (<a href="#Fig_40">Fig. 40</a>),
near Meifod in Montgomeryshire, defending the valley
of the Vyrnwy.&mdash;Here was the chief royal residence of
Powys;<a name="FNanchor_887" id="FNanchor_887"></a><a href="#Footnote_887" class="fnanchor">[887]</a> but the castle was built in John&rsquo;s reign by
Roger de Vipont. It occupied 2&frac14; acres, and the motte
is in one corner of the area, which is square,<a name="FNanchor_888" id="FNanchor_888"></a><a href="#Footnote_888" class="fnanchor">[888]</a> and
surrounded only by banks; though ruined foundations
are found in parts of the castle. John himself burned
the castle in 1211, when the Welsh were besieging it,<a name="FNanchor_889" id="FNanchor_889"></a><a href="#Footnote_889" class="fnanchor">[889]</a>
but the <i>Pipe Roll</i> (1212-1213) shows that he afterwards
repaired it. [D. H. M.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Egloe</span>, or Eulo, called by Leland Castle Yollo.&mdash;On
the Chester and Holywell road, about 8 miles from
Holywell. The mention in the <i>Pipe Roll</i> of pikes and
ammunition provided for this castle in 1212-1213 is the
first ancient allusion to it with which we are acquainted.
It is a motte-and-bailey castle, with additions in
masonry which are probably of the reign of Henry III.
The keep is of the &ldquo;thimble&rdquo; plan, a rare instance.<a name="FNanchor_890" id="FNanchor_890"></a><a href="#Footnote_890" class="fnanchor">[890]</a>
[B. T. S.]</p>

<p>*<span class="smcap">Yale.</span>&mdash;The <i>Brut</i> tells us that in 1148 (read 1150)
Owen Gwynedd built a castle in Yale. Powell identified
this with Tomen y Rhodwydd, a motte and bailey on
the road between Llangollen and Ruthin. Yale,
however, is the name of a district, and there can be
little doubt that the castle of Yale was the motte and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
bailey at Llanarmon, which for a long period was the
<i>caput</i> of Yale.<a name="FNanchor_891" id="FNanchor_891"></a><a href="#Footnote_891" class="fnanchor">[891]</a> Yale undoubtedly belonged to the
Normans when Domesday Book was compiled,<a name="FNanchor_892" id="FNanchor_892"></a><a href="#Footnote_892" class="fnanchor">[892]</a> and it
is therefore not unlikely that these earthworks were first
thrown up by the Earl of Chester. The castle was
burnt by Jorwerth Goch in 1158, but restored by John in
1212. One of the expenses entered for that year is
&ldquo;for iron mallets for breaking the rocks in the ditch of
the castle of Yale.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_893" id="FNanchor_893"></a><a href="#Footnote_893" class="fnanchor">[893]</a> This ditch cut in the rock still
remains, as well as some foundations on the motte,<a name="FNanchor_894" id="FNanchor_894"></a><a href="#Footnote_894" class="fnanchor">[894]</a>
which is known as Tomen y Vardra, or the Mount of
the demesne.<a name="FNanchor_895" id="FNanchor_895"></a><a href="#Footnote_895" class="fnanchor">[895]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>How long the two last-mentioned groups of castles
continued in Anglo-Norman hands we do not attempt
to say. North Wales, as is well known, reaped a
harvest of new power and prosperity through the civil
war of the end of John&rsquo;s reign, and the ability of
Llywelyn ap Jorwerth. Our task ends with the reign
of John. We have only to remark that until the <i>Pipe
Rolls</i> of Henry III.&rsquo;s reign have been carefully searched,
it is impossible to say with certainty what castles of
North Wales, or if any, were still held by the English
king.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a><br />
<span class="smaller">MOTTE-CASTLES IN SOUTH WALES</span></h2>

<p>It is not possible to fix certain dates for all the Norman
conquests of the several provinces of South Wales.
These conquests proceeded from various points, under
different leaders. We might have expected that the
earliest advances would have been on the Herefordshire
border, the earldom of Hereford having been given by
William I. to William FitzOsbern, one of his most
trusted and energetic servants. Ordericus tells us that
FitzOsbern and Walter de Lacy first invaded the
district of Brecknock, and defeated three kings of
the Welsh.<a name="FNanchor_896" id="FNanchor_896"></a><a href="#Footnote_896" class="fnanchor">[896]</a> This looks as though the conquest of
Brecknock was then begun. But it was not completed
till the reign of Rufus; in 1093 Bernard of Neufmarché
defeated and slew Rhys ap Tudor, King of South Wales,
in a battle which the Welsh chronicler speaks of as the
fall of the kingdom of the Britons.<a name="FNanchor_897" id="FNanchor_897"></a><a href="#Footnote_897" class="fnanchor">[897]</a> William FitzOsbern
died in 1071, and he had scarcely time to
accomplish more than the building of the border castles
of Wigmore, Clifford, Ewias, and Monmouth, and the
incastellation of Gwent, that is the country between the
Wye and the Usk, which had already been conquered
by Harold.</p>

<p>It seems probable that Pembrokeshire was one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
of the earliest Norman conquests in South Wales,
as in 1073 and 1074 the <i>Brut</i> tells of two
expeditions of &ldquo;the French&rdquo; into Dyfed, a region which
included not only what we now call Pembrokeshire, but
also Strath Towy, which comprised an extensive district
on both sides of the valley of the Towy.<a name="FNanchor_898" id="FNanchor_898"></a><a href="#Footnote_898" class="fnanchor">[898]</a> The <i>Annales
Cambriæ</i> name Hugh de Montgomeri, Earl Roger&rsquo;s
eldest son, in connection with the second of these
expeditions, seven years before the expedition of King
William into Wales in 1081.<a name="FNanchor_899" id="FNanchor_899"></a><a href="#Footnote_899" class="fnanchor">[899]</a> The House of Montgomeri
certainly took the most conspicuous part in the conquest
of Dyfed and Cardigan, which was completed, according
to the <i>Brut</i>, in 1093.<a name="FNanchor_900" id="FNanchor_900"></a><a href="#Footnote_900" class="fnanchor">[900]</a> Arnulf of Montgomeri, fifth
son of Earl Roger, was the leader of this conquest.
But his father must at the same time have been
operating in Cardigan, as the building of the castle
of Cilgerran, which is on the very borders of Pembroke
and Cardigan, is attributed to him.</p>

<p>How far Earl Roger made himself master of Ceredigion
it is impossible to say. Later writers say that
he built the castle of Cardigan, but we have not been
able to find any early authority for this statement, which
in itself is not improbable. Powell&rsquo;s <i>History</i> makes him
do homage to William Rufus for the lordship of Cardigan,
but here again the authority is doubtful.<a name="FNanchor_901" id="FNanchor_901"></a><a href="#Footnote_901" class="fnanchor">[901]</a> The fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
that a castle in or near Aberystwyth was not built
until 1109 may indicate that the conquest of Northern
Cardigan was not completed till it became the portion
of the De Clares. This took place in 1109, when
Henry I. deposed Cadwgan, a Welsh prince whom he
had made Lord of Cardigan, and gave the lordship to
Gilbert de Clare, who immediately proceeded to build
the above-mentioned castle, and to restore Earl Roger&rsquo;s
castle at Cilgerran (Dingeraint).<a name="FNanchor_902" id="FNanchor_902"></a><a href="#Footnote_902" class="fnanchor">[902]</a> From this time the
castle and district of Cardigan continued to be an
appanage of the House of Clare (of course with frequent
interruptions from Welsh invasions), and of the family
of William Marshall, to whom the Clare lands came
by marriage. The authority of these earls was suspended
during the reign of Henry II., when he made Rhys
ap Griffith, who had possessed himself of Ceredigion
by conquest, Justiciar of South Wales, but in the reigns
of John and Henry III., the <i>Close Rolls</i> show that
Cardigan Castle and county were generally in the hands
of the Marshalls.</p>

<p>The conquest of Pembrokeshire must have been
closely followed by that of what is now Carmarthenshire,
which was then reckoned as part of Dyfed.<a name="FNanchor_903" id="FNanchor_903"></a><a href="#Footnote_903" class="fnanchor">[903]</a> We first
hear of the castle of Rhyd y Gors in 1094,<a name="FNanchor_904" id="FNanchor_904"></a><a href="#Footnote_904" class="fnanchor">[904]</a> but it
evidently existed earlier. This castle we believe to
have been the important castle of Carmarthen (see
<i><a href="#Carmarthen">post</a></i>). It was founded by William, son of Baldwin,
sheriff of Devon, and cousin of the Gilbert de Clare
who at a later period was made Lord of Cardigan by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
Henry I. We thus see at what an early date this
important family made its appearance in Welsh history.</p>

<p>The conquest of Brecknock (Brecheiniog) we have
already briefly referred to. It must have begun as early
as 1088, for in that year Bernard de Neufmarché gave
to St Peter&rsquo;s Abbey at Gloucester the church and manor
of Glasbury. The inheritance of Bernard passed by
marriage to the De Braoses, and from them to the
Mortimers. It is convenient to mention in this connection
the Norman conquest of Radnor, of which the
De Braoses and Mortimers were the heroes. A charter
of Philip de Braose, not later than 1096, is dated at
&ldquo;Raddenoam.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_905" id="FNanchor_905"></a><a href="#Footnote_905" class="fnanchor">[905]</a> Even during the anarchy of Stephen&rsquo;s
reign, the Mortimers were able to maintain their hold
on this district, for the <i>Brut</i> relates that in 1145, Hugh,
son of Ralph Mortimer, conquered Malienydd and
Elvael the second time.<a name="FNanchor_906" id="FNanchor_906"></a><a href="#Footnote_906" class="fnanchor">[906]</a> These two districts properly
belong to Powys, though geographically in South Wales.</p>

<p>We leave to the last the conquest of Glamorgan,
which may possibly have been one of the earliest, but
whose date is still a matter of dispute, owing to the
legendary nature of the Aberpergwm version of the
<i>Brut</i>, the only one which even alludes to this conquest.
We have, however, an initial date given us in the year
1082, when the <i>Brut y Tywysogion</i> tell us of the
building of Cardiff Castle.<a name="FNanchor_907" id="FNanchor_907"></a><a href="#Footnote_907" class="fnanchor">[907]</a> The conquest of &ldquo;Morgannwg,&rdquo;
that is the country between the Usk and the
Neath, was the most permanent of any of those
accomplished by the Normans in Wales, but its details<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
are the most obscure of any. The earlier version of the
<i>Brut</i> takes no notice of the conquest of Glamorgan;
the later version which goes by the name of the
<i>Gwentian Chronicle</i><a name="FNanchor_908" id="FNanchor_908"></a><a href="#Footnote_908" class="fnanchor">[908]</a> tells us that the Norman Robert
Fitz Hamon, being called in to the help of one Welsh
prince against another, conquered Glamorgan for himself,
and divided it amongst his followers, who built
castles in all parts of the country. The date given is
1088. It seems to be agreed by historians that while
the facts of Robert Fitz Hamon&rsquo;s existence and of his
conquest of Glamorgan are certain, the details and
the list of followers given in this chronicle are quite
untrustworthy.<a name="FNanchor_909" id="FNanchor_909"></a><a href="#Footnote_909" class="fnanchor">[909]</a></p>

<p>The district called Gower did not then form part of
Glamorgan, as it does now, though it is still ecclesiastically
separate. If we are to believe the Aberpergwm <i>Brut</i>,
it must have been conquered in 1094, when William de
Londres, one of the &ldquo;knights&rdquo; of Robert Fitz Hamon,
built a strong castle in Cydweli (Kidwelly).<a name="FNanchor_910" id="FNanchor_910"></a><a href="#Footnote_910" class="fnanchor">[910]</a></p>

<p>We will now briefly notice such of the castles of these
various districts as are mentioned in the sources to which
we have already referred in our last chapter, taking them
in the order of the modern counties in which they are
found.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Castles of Pembrokeshire.</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Pembroke.</span>&mdash;Giraldus says that Arnulf de Montgomeri
first built this castle of sods and wattles, a
scanty and slender construction, in the reign of Henry
I.<a name="FNanchor_911" id="FNanchor_911"></a><a href="#Footnote_911" class="fnanchor">[911]</a> This date, however, must certainly be wrong, for
the castle sustained a siege from the Welsh in 1094, and
in 1098 Arnulf gave the chapel of St Nicholas in his
castle of Pembroke to the abbey of St Martin at Sées.<a name="FNanchor_912" id="FNanchor_912"></a><a href="#Footnote_912" class="fnanchor">[912]</a>
There is no motte at Pembroke Castle; the magnificent
keep (clearly of the 13th century or later) stands in a
small ward at the edge of a cliff,<a name="FNanchor_913" id="FNanchor_913"></a><a href="#Footnote_913" class="fnanchor">[913]</a> separated by a former
ditch from the immense encircling bailey whose walls
and towers are clearly of Edwardian date. The words
of Giraldus &ldquo;a castle of wattles and turf&rdquo; might lead us
to think that the first castle was a motte of the usual
type, but the use which he makes of the same expression
in his work on Ireland leads one to think that he means
a less defensible fort, a mere bank and fence.<a name="FNanchor_914" id="FNanchor_914"></a><a href="#Footnote_914" class="fnanchor">[914]</a> There is
some reason, moreover, to doubt whether the present
castle of Pembroke stands on the same site as Arnulf&rsquo;s,
as after the banishment of the latter, Gerald, the royal
Seneschal of Pembroke &ldquo;built the castle anew in the
place called Little Cengarth.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_915" id="FNanchor_915"></a><a href="#Footnote_915" class="fnanchor">[915]</a></p>

<p>But however this may be, the castle of Pembroke
was certainly strong enough in 1094 to resist a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
insurrection of the Welsh, when all the castles of south-west
Wales were destroyed, except Pembroke and Rhyd
y Gors. And it continued to be one of the chief strongholds
of English power in South Wales until Edward
I. completed the conquest of the country. Its splendid
situation on a high cliff at the mouth of an excellent
harbour, to which supplies could be brought by sea, was
one of the secrets of its strength. A passage cut in the
rock led from the castle to a cave below opening on to
the water.</p>

<p>*<span class="smcap">Newport</span>, or Trefdaeth, was the head of the Barony
of Keymes, an independent lordship founded at the time
of the first Norman advance, by Martin of Tours.<a name="FNanchor_916" id="FNanchor_916"></a><a href="#Footnote_916" class="fnanchor">[916]</a>
There is no mention of it before 1215. The present
ruined castle of Newport is not earlier than the 13th
century, but about 1&frac12; miles higher up the river, at
Llanhyfer, is a fine motte and bailey, which probably
mark the site of the first castle of Martin of Tours.<a name="FNanchor_917" id="FNanchor_917"></a><a href="#Footnote_917" class="fnanchor">[917]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wiston</span>, <i>alias</i> Gwys or Wiz.&mdash;First mentioned in
1148, when it was taken by the Welsh.<a name="FNanchor_918" id="FNanchor_918"></a><a href="#Footnote_918" class="fnanchor">[918]</a> At a later
period we find it one of the castles of the Earl of
Pembroke. There is a motte still remaining, with a
shell wall on top, 6 feet thick, having a plain round
arched entrance. This masonry is probably the work of
William Marshall, Earl of Pembroke, as he restored the
castle in 1220 after it had been razed to the ground by
Llywelyn ap Jorwerth.<a name="FNanchor_919" id="FNanchor_919"></a><a href="#Footnote_919" class="fnanchor">[919]</a> The bailey is large and bean-shaped.</p>

mention in 1192.<a name="FNanchor_920" id="FNanchor_920"></a><a href="#Footnote_920" class="fnanchor">[920]</a> It afterwards became a palace of the
bishops of St David&rsquo;s. There is no motte, though the
circular outline of the platform on which the fine ruins
of the castle stand, very much suggests a lowered motte.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Haverfordwest.</span>&mdash;First mentioned in the <i>Pipe
Roll</i> of 1214-1215, when it was in the custody of the Earl
of Pembroke. Although this castle is now a gaol, and
the whole site masked with gaol buildings, the motte
can still be seen distinctly from one side, though the
keep which stands upon it is blocked by buildings. The
ditch which went round the motte can also be traced.
[H. W.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Narberth.</span>&mdash;This castle is first mentioned in 1115,
when it was burnt by the Welsh. Said to have been
the castle of Stephen Perrot.<a name="FNanchor_921" id="FNanchor_921"></a><a href="#Footnote_921" class="fnanchor">[921]</a> The present ruins are
entirely of the 13th century, and there is no motte; but
Lewis states that the first castle was in another site,
between the present town and Templeton; about which
we have no information.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tenby.</span>&mdash;First mention in 1152. An important coast
station. The small and curious round keep is placed on
the highest point of a small island; it is a miniature
copy of the keep of Pembroke, and was probably built
by one of the earls Marshall, not earlier than the 13th
century. There is no motte, nor was one needed in
such a situation.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Castles of Cardigan.</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cardigan</span> Castle, or Aberteifi, has been so much
transformed by the incorporation of the keep into a
modern house that nothing decisive can be said about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
its original plan, but there is nothing to foreclose the
idea of a previous motte, and Speed&rsquo;s plan of 1611 seems
to show that the keep and the small ward attached to it
were on a higher elevation than the bailey. That the
first castle was a wooden one is rendered almost certain
by the fact that Rhys ap Griffith, after having
demolished the previous castle, rebuilt it <i>with stone and
mortar</i>, in the reign of Henry II.<a name="FNanchor_922" id="FNanchor_922"></a><a href="#Footnote_922" class="fnanchor">[922]</a> The Welsh
chronicler speaks of this castle as the key of all Wales,
an exaggeration certainly, but it was undoubtedly the
most important stronghold of South Ceredigion. [H. W.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cilgerran</span>, or Dingeraint (<a href="#Fig_41">Fig. 41</a>).&mdash;This castle
was certainly built by Earl Roger;<a name="FNanchor_923" id="FNanchor_923"></a><a href="#Footnote_923" class="fnanchor">[923]</a> a castle of great
importance, in a magnificent situation. Like nearly all
the castles in our Welsh list, it was repeatedly taken by
the Welsh and retaken from them. The present
masonry is of the 13th century, but the original motte-and-bailey
plan is quite discernible. [H. W.] It was
a connecting link between the castles of Pembrokeshire
and those of Cardigan, and stands near a road leading
directly from Tenby and Narberth to Cardigan.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aberystwyth</span>, also Lampadarn Vaur, also Aberrheiddiol.<a name="FNanchor_924" id="FNanchor_924"></a><a href="#Footnote_924" class="fnanchor">[924]</a>
In 1109 Henry I. deposed Cadwgan, a
Welsh prince who had purchased from the king the
government of Cardigan, and gave that country to
Gilbert, son of Richard, Earl of Clare, who took
possession, and built a castle &ldquo;opposite to Llanbadarn,
near the mouth of the river Ystwyth.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_925" id="FNanchor_925"></a><a href="#Footnote_925" class="fnanchor">[925]</a> This was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
undoubtedly the precursor of the modern castle of
Aberystwyth, but it is doubtful whether it was on the
same site; the present ruins are not opposite Llanbadarn.
The castle was as important for the defence of
N. Cardigan as Cardigan Castle for the south. It was
taken at least seven times by the Welsh, and burnt at
least five times. The present ruins are not earlier than
the time of Edward I., and there is no motte or keep.
[H. W.]</p>

<p>*<span class="smcap">Blaenporth</span>, or Castell Gwythan (<a href="#Fig_41">Fig. 41</a>).&mdash;Also
built by Gilbert de Clare, and evidently placed to defend
the main road from Cardigan to Aberystwyth. The
motte and bailey are still remarkably perfect, as shown
by the 25-inch Ordnance Map.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ystrad Peithyll.</span>&mdash;Another of Gilbert de Clare&rsquo;s
castles, as it was inhabited by his steward. It was
burnt by the Welsh in 1115,<a name="FNanchor_926" id="FNanchor_926"></a><a href="#Footnote_926" class="fnanchor">[926]</a> and is never mentioned
again, but its motte and ditch still survive, with some
signs of a bailey, close to the little stream of the
Peithyll, near Aberystwyth. [H. W.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chastell Gwalter</span>, or Llanfihangel, in Pengwern
(<a href="#Fig_41">Fig. 41</a>).&mdash;Castle of Walter de Bec, probably one of
the barons of Gilbert de Clare. First mentioned in
1137, when it was burned by the Welsh.<a name="FNanchor_927" id="FNanchor_927"></a><a href="#Footnote_927" class="fnanchor">[927]</a> There is a
small but well-made motte and part of an adjoining
bailey standing in a most commanding position on a
high plateau. The ditch of the motte is excavated in
the rock. [D. H. M.]</p>

<p>*<span class="smcap">Dinerth.</span>&mdash;Also burnt in 1137; restored by Roger,
Earl of Clare, in 1159, after which it underwent many
vicissitudes.<a name="FNanchor_928" id="FNanchor_928"></a><a href="#Footnote_928" class="fnanchor">[928]</a> Probably originally a castle of the Clares.
&ldquo;In the grounds of Mynachty, in the parish of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
Llanbadarn Tref Eglwys, is a small hill called Hero
Castell, probably the site of the keep of Dinerth
Castle.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_929" id="FNanchor_929"></a><a href="#Footnote_929" class="fnanchor">[929]</a> The O.M. shows a small motte and bailey
placed between two streams.</p>

<p>*<span class="smcap">Caerwedros</span>, or Castell Llwyndafydd, also burned by
the Welsh in 1137,<a name="FNanchor_930" id="FNanchor_930"></a><a href="#Footnote_930" class="fnanchor">[930]</a> after which it is not mentioned
again. &ldquo;A very large moated tumulus, with foundations
of walls on the top.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_931" id="FNanchor_931"></a><a href="#Footnote_931" class="fnanchor">[931]</a> Probably a Clare castle.</p>

<p>*<span class="smcap">Humphrey&rsquo;s Castle</span>, now Castle Howel, from one
of its Welsh conquerors. The original name shows
that it was built by a Norman, and it was restored by
Roger, Earl of Clare, in 1159.<a name="FNanchor_932" id="FNanchor_932"></a><a href="#Footnote_932" class="fnanchor">[932]</a> A moated tumulus near
the river Clettwr marks the site of Humphrey&rsquo;s Castle.<a name="FNanchor_933" id="FNanchor_933"></a><a href="#Footnote_933" class="fnanchor">[933]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ystrad Meurug</span>, or Meyric, at the head of the valley
of the Teifi, and commanding the pass leading over
into Radnorshire.&mdash;Built by Gilbert de Clare when he
reconquered Cardigan, and one of his most important
castles.<a name="FNanchor_934" id="FNanchor_934"></a><a href="#Footnote_934" class="fnanchor">[934]</a> Its importance is shown by the fact that it
had a small stone keep, the date of which cannot now
be determined, as only the foundations remain, buried
under sods. There is no motte, and the bailey can only
be guessed at by a portion of the ditch which still
remains on the N. side, and by two platforms which
appear to be artificially levelled. The castle is about
three miles from the Sarn Helen or Roman road
through Cardigan.</p>

<p>*<span class="smcap">Pont y Stuffan</span>, or Stephen&rsquo;s Bridge, near
Lampeter.&mdash;Burnt by the Welsh in 1138, and not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
again mentioned.<a name="FNanchor_935" id="FNanchor_935"></a><a href="#Footnote_935" class="fnanchor">[935]</a> In the outskirts of the town of
Lampeter is&mdash;or was&mdash;a lofty moated tumulus (not
shown on O.M.), and traces of a quadrangular court.<a name="FNanchor_936" id="FNanchor_936"></a><a href="#Footnote_936" class="fnanchor">[936]</a>
As it is also called Castell Ystuffan, it was probably
built by Stephen, the Norman constable of Cardigan.
There appears to be another castle mound at Lampeter
itself, near the church. Lampeter was an important
post on the Roman road up the valley of the Teifi.</p>

<p>*<span class="smcap">Nant yr Arian.</span>&mdash;This castle is only mentioned
once, in the partition of Cardigan and Pembroke which
took place in 1216, during the most disastrous part of
John&rsquo;s reign.<a name="FNanchor_937" id="FNanchor_937"></a><a href="#Footnote_937" class="fnanchor">[937]</a> There are two &ldquo;castellau&rdquo; marked at
Nant yr Arian in the N. of Cardiganshire in the
O.M.; neither of them look like mottes. This castle,
as well as that of Ystrad Peithyll, seems to have been
placed to defend the road from Aberystwyth to Llanidloes,
which would be the chief highway between Shropshire
and Ceredigion.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Castles of Carmarthenshire.</span></h3>

<p id="Carmarthen"><span class="smcap">Rhyd y Gors</span>, or Rhyd Cors.&mdash;We have no hesitation
in adopting the opinion of the late Mr Floyd, that this
is another name for the castle of Carmarthen.<a name="FNanchor_938" id="FNanchor_938"></a><a href="#Footnote_938" class="fnanchor">[938]</a> As it
and Pembroke were the only castles which held out
during the great Welsh revolt of 1096,<a name="FNanchor_939" id="FNanchor_939"></a><a href="#Footnote_939" class="fnanchor">[939]</a> it is evident that
they were the two strongest and best defended places,
therefore the most important. Carmarthen also was a
Roman city, and its walls were still standing in
Giraldus&rsquo; time;<a name="FNanchor_940" id="FNanchor_940"></a><a href="#Footnote_940" class="fnanchor">[940]</a> it was therefore the place where one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
would expect to find a Norman castle. Now Carmarthen,
along with Cardiff and Pembroke, continued
up till the final conquest of all Wales to be the most
important seat of English power in South Wales.
Moreover, Rhyd y Gors was a royal castle; we
are expressly told that it was built by William Fitz
Baldwin, by the command of the king of England.<a name="FNanchor_941" id="FNanchor_941"></a><a href="#Footnote_941" class="fnanchor">[941]</a>
Carmarthen also was a royal castle, and the only
one in South Wales at that date which belonged
directly to the king. It was temporarily abandoned
after William Fitz Baldwin&rsquo;s death in 1096, and
afterwards Henry I. gave it into the custody of a
Welshman, who also had charge of Strath Towy; a
passage which proves that Rhyd y Gors was in that
district. It was restored by Richard Fitz Baldwin
in 1104,<a name="FNanchor_942" id="FNanchor_942"></a><a href="#Footnote_942" class="fnanchor">[942]</a> and is mentioned for the last time in 1105.
After that the castle of Carmarthen, which has
not been mentioned before, begins to appear, and its
importance is clear from the continual references to it.
Placed as it is on a navigable river, at the entrance of
the narrower part of the vale of Towy, and on the
Roman road from Brecon to St David&rsquo;s, its natural
position must have marked it as a fit site for a royal
castle. The castle is now converted into a gaol, and
disfigured in the usual way; yet the ancient motte of
William Fitz Baldwin still remains, partly inside and
partly outside the walls. It is crowned with a stone
revetment which Colonel Morgan believes to have been
erected at the time of the Civil War, to form a platform<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
for guns.<a name="FNanchor_943" id="FNanchor_943"></a><a href="#Footnote_943" class="fnanchor">[943]</a> The bailey is rectangular and covers about 2
acres. The motte is placed at one corner of it, on the
line of the walls. On the outside it is now built over
with poor cottages; but the site of the ditch can still be
traced.</p>

<p>*<span class="smcap">Llandovery</span>, or Llanymdyfri, or the castle of
Cantrebohhan.&mdash;It is referred to in the <i>Pipe Rolls</i> of
1159-1160 by the latter name, which is only a Norman
way of spelling Cantref Bychan, the little cantref or
hundred, of which this castle was the head.<a name="FNanchor_944" id="FNanchor_944"></a><a href="#Footnote_944" class="fnanchor">[944]</a> It was
then in royal custody, and Henry II. spent nearly £60
on its works. But it had originally belonged to Richard
Fitz Pons, one of the barons of Bernard de Neufmarché,
and the fact that he held the key of this cantref goes to
prove that it was from Brecknock that the Normans
advanced into northern Carmarthenshire. The castle
is first mentioned in the <i>Brut</i> in 1115, when Griffith ap
Rhys burnt the bailey, but could not take the keep on
the motte.<a name="FNanchor_945" id="FNanchor_945"></a><a href="#Footnote_945" class="fnanchor">[945]</a> It does not appear to have been long in
English hands after 1159, but its alternations were
many. The 25-inch O.M. shows an oval motte,
carrying some fragments of masonry, to which is
attached a roughly quadrangular bailey. This was one
of the many castles by which the Normans held Strath
Towy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Llanstephan.</span><a name="FNanchor_946" id="FNanchor_946"></a><a href="#Footnote_946" class="fnanchor">[946]</a>&mdash;This castle stands in a splendid
situation at the mouth of the Towy, and was doubtless
built to secure a maritime base for Carmarthen. The
motte is of unusual size, semicircular in shape, one side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
being on the edge of the cliff; it measures 300 feet
by 200 in the centre of the arc.<a name="FNanchor_947" id="FNanchor_947"></a><a href="#Footnote_947" class="fnanchor">[947]</a> Such a size allowed
all the important parts of the castle to be built on the
motte; but there was a rectangular bailey attached, which
is only imperfectly shown on the O.M.; the scarp
is in reality well marked on all sides, and the ditch
separating it from the motte is a very deep one. [H. W.]
The towers that now crown the motte are not earlier
than the year 1256, when the castle was destroyed by
Llywelyn.<a name="FNanchor_948" id="FNanchor_948"></a><a href="#Footnote_948" class="fnanchor">[948]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dinevor</span>, or Dinweiler.&mdash;Most Welsh writers associate
Dinevor with the ancient residence of the kings
of South Wales, but there appears to be some doubt
about this, as the place is not mentioned before the 12th
century.<a name="FNanchor_949" id="FNanchor_949"></a><a href="#Footnote_949" class="fnanchor">[949]</a> Anyhow the castle was certainly the work of
Earl Gilbert, as the <i>Brut</i> itself tells us so.<a name="FNanchor_950" id="FNanchor_950"></a><a href="#Footnote_950" class="fnanchor">[950]</a> In 1162 it
was taken by Rhys ap Griffith, the able prince who
attempted the consolidation of South Wales, and who
was made Justiciar of that province by Henry II. It
continued in Welsh hands, sometimes hostile, sometimes
allied, till it was finally taken by the English in 1277.
The existing ruins are entirely of the 13th century, but
the plan certainly suggests a previous motte and bailey,
the motte having probably been lowered to form the
present smaller ward, whose walls and towers appear to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
be of Edward I.&rsquo;s reign. The small bailey attached to
this ward is separated from it by a ditch cut through
the headland on which the castle stands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kidwelly</span> (Cydweli).&mdash;This castle, though in Carmarthen,
was not founded by the conquerors from
Brecknock, but by Normans from Glamorgan or Gower.
Kidwelly was first built by William de Londres, in
1094.<a name="FNanchor_951" id="FNanchor_951"></a><a href="#Footnote_951" class="fnanchor">[951]</a> The present castle shows no trace of this early
origin, but is a fine specimen of the keepless pattern
introduced into England in the 13th century.<a name="FNanchor_952" id="FNanchor_952"></a><a href="#Footnote_952" class="fnanchor">[952]</a> There is
no motte.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Laugharne</span>, or Talycharne.&mdash;Also called Abercorran,
being at the point where the little river Corran
flows into the estuary of the Taff. In 1113 this castle
belonged to a Norman named Robert Courtmain.<a name="FNanchor_953" id="FNanchor_953"></a><a href="#Footnote_953" class="fnanchor">[953]</a> The
ancient features of the plan have been obliterated by
transformation first into an Edwardian castle, then
into a modern house. There is of course no motte.
[H. W.]</p>

<p>*<span class="smcap">Ystrad Cyngen.</span>&mdash;This must, we think, be the
same as <span class="smcap">St Clears</span>, which stands in the Cynen valley,
near its junction with the Taff. Welsh writers identify
St Clears with the castle of Mabudrud, the name of the
<i>commot</i> in which it stands. First mentioned in 1154.<a name="FNanchor_954" id="FNanchor_954"></a><a href="#Footnote_954" class="fnanchor">[954]</a>
There is no notice of its origin, but the fact that a
Cluniac priory existed in the village, which was a cell of
St Martin des Champs at Paris, points to a Norman
founder, and renders an 11th century date probable. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
was a motte-and-bailey castle, of which the earthworks
remain.<a name="FNanchor_955" id="FNanchor_955"></a><a href="#Footnote_955" class="fnanchor">[955]</a></p>

<p>*<span class="smcap">Newcastle Emlyn.</span>&mdash;This castle does not appear to
have received the name of &ldquo;the new castle of Emlyn&rdquo;
till after Edward I.&rsquo;s conquest.<a name="FNanchor_956" id="FNanchor_956"></a><a href="#Footnote_956" class="fnanchor">[956]</a> The new castle, which
is quite Edwardian, was probably built on a different
site to the old, as &ldquo;on the other side of the bridge is a
considerable mount, of a military character, which must
have commanded the river. It may have been the
original strong post occupied by the Normans.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_957" id="FNanchor_957"></a><a href="#Footnote_957" class="fnanchor">[957]</a> In
the 12th century <i>Pipe Rolls</i> compensation is paid to
William FitzGerald for many years &ldquo;as long as Rhys ap
Griffith holds the castle of Emlyn,&rdquo; which points to
Gerald, the Seneschal of Pembroke, or his family, as its
founders. It is on the very border of Carmarthenshire
and Cardiganshire, defending the main road from
Carmarthen to Cardigan.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Llanegwad.</span>&mdash;This castle is only once mentioned, in
the <i>Brut</i>, under the year 1203, when it was taken by the
Welsh. A small motte, called locally Pen y Knap, with
an earthen breastwork round the top, is still standing
about a mile from the church of Llanegwad, and is all
that is left of this castle. The position commands a fine
view over the Towy valley, and it is noteworthy that it
stands very near the supposed Roman road from Brecon
to Carmarthen. [H. W.]</p>

<p>*<span class="smcap">Llangadog.</span>&mdash;This castle also does not appear till
1203; it was razed or burnt at least thrice in five years.<a name="FNanchor_958" id="FNanchor_958"></a><a href="#Footnote_958" class="fnanchor">[958]</a>
A mound of earth on the banks of the Sawddwy River,
near where the Roman road from Brecon is supposed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
have reached the Towy valley, is all that remains of it.<a name="FNanchor_959" id="FNanchor_959"></a><a href="#Footnote_959" class="fnanchor">[959]</a>
Lewis says that it stands in a large oval entrenchment,
and that the motte is of natural rock, scarped conically,
and deeply moated.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Castles in Brecknockshire.</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Brecon</span>, or Aberhonddu, the seat of Bernard de
Neufmarché himself.&mdash;A charter of Bernard&rsquo;s mentions
the castle.<a name="FNanchor_960" id="FNanchor_960"></a><a href="#Footnote_960" class="fnanchor">[960]</a> It seems to have been a particularly strong
place, as we do not hear of its having been burnt more
than once. The newer castle of Brecon is evidently of
the time of Edward I., but across the road the old
motte of Bernard is still standing, and carries the ruins
of a shell wall, with a gatehouse tower.<a name="FNanchor_961" id="FNanchor_961"></a><a href="#Footnote_961" class="fnanchor">[961]</a> A portion of
the bank and ditch of the bailey remains; the whole is
now in a private garden. The situation is a strong one,
between the Usk and the Honddu. Brecon of course
was a burgus, and part of the bank which fortified it
remains.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Builth</span>, on the upper Wye, <i>alias</i> Buallt (<a href="#Fig_42">Fig. 42</a>).&mdash;A
remarkably fine motte and bailey, presenting some
peculiarities of plan. It is not mentioned till 1210,<a name="FNanchor_962" id="FNanchor_962"></a><a href="#Footnote_962" class="fnanchor">[962]</a> but
it has been conjectured with great probability that it
was one of the castles built by Bernard de Neufmarché<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
when he conquered Brecknock.<a name="FNanchor_963" id="FNanchor_963"></a><a href="#Footnote_963" class="fnanchor">[963]</a> It was refortified by
John Mortimer in 1242,<a name="FNanchor_964" id="FNanchor_964"></a><a href="#Footnote_964" class="fnanchor">[964]</a> probably in stone, as in the
account of its destruction by Llywelyn in 1260 it is said
that &ldquo;not one stone was left on another.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_965" id="FNanchor_965"></a><a href="#Footnote_965" class="fnanchor">[965]</a> Nevertheless
when Edward I. rebuilt it the towers on the outer wall
appear to have been of wood.<a name="FNanchor_966" id="FNanchor_966"></a><a href="#Footnote_966" class="fnanchor">[966]</a> Mr Clark states that
there are traces of masonry foundations and small
portions of a wing wall. The bailey of this castle
consists of a rather narrow platform, divided into two
unequal portions by a cross ditch which connects the
ditch of the motte with that of the bailey. The ditch
round the motte is of unusual breadth, being 120 feet
broad in the widest part. The whole work is encircled
by an outer ditch of varying breadth, being 100 feet
wide on the weakest side of the work, and by a counterscarp
bank which appears to be still perfect. The
entrance is defended by four small mounds which
probably cover the remains of towers.<a name="FNanchor_967" id="FNanchor_967"></a><a href="#Footnote_967" class="fnanchor">[967]</a> The area of
the two baileys together is only 1 acre. [D. H. M.]</p>

<p>*<span class="smcap">Hay</span>, or Tregelli.&mdash;The earliest mention of this
castle is in a charter of Henry I.<a name="FNanchor_968" id="FNanchor_968"></a><a href="#Footnote_968" class="fnanchor">[968]</a> The present castle
of Hay is of late date, but Leland tells us that &ldquo;not
far from the Paroche Chirch is a great round Hille of
Yerth cast up by Men&rsquo;s Hondes.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_969" id="FNanchor_969"></a><a href="#Footnote_969" class="fnanchor">[969]</a> It is shown on the
25-inch O.M., and so is the line of the borough walls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span></p>

<p>*<span class="smcap">Talgarth.</span>&mdash;Mentioned in a charter of Roger, Earl
of Hereford, not later than 1156.<a name="FNanchor_970" id="FNanchor_970"></a><a href="#Footnote_970" class="fnanchor">[970]</a> A 13th-century tower
on a small motte is still standing, and can be seen from
the railway between Brecon and Hereford.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Castles of Radnorshire.</span></h3>

<p>*<span class="smcap">Radnor</span>, or Maes Hyvaidd.&mdash;Though this castle is
not mentioned in the <i>Brut</i> till 1196, when it was burnt
by Rhys ap Griffith, it must have been built by the
Normans at a very early period. The English had
penetrated into the Radnor district even before the
Norman Conquest,<a name="FNanchor_971" id="FNanchor_971"></a><a href="#Footnote_971" class="fnanchor">[971]</a> and the Normans were not slow to
follow them. A charter of Philip de Braose is granted
at &ldquo;Raddenoam&rdquo; not later than 1096.<a name="FNanchor_972" id="FNanchor_972"></a><a href="#Footnote_972" class="fnanchor">[972]</a> There are
mottes both at Old and New Radnor, towns three miles
distant from each other, so that it is impossible to say
which was the Maes Hyvaidd of the <i>Brut</i>. Both may
have been originally De Braose castles, but New
Radnor evidently became the more important place, and
has massive remains in masonry. The town was a
<i>burgus</i>.</p>

<p>*<span class="smcap">Gemaron</span>, or Cwm Aron (<a href="#Fig_42">Fig. 42</a>).&mdash;Near Llandewi-Ystrad-denny.
The <i>Brut</i> mentions its repair by Hugh
Mortimer in 1145.<a name="FNanchor_973" id="FNanchor_973"></a><a href="#Footnote_973" class="fnanchor">[973]</a> The 6-inch O.M. shows a square
central bailey of 1 acre, containing some remains of
masonry, lying between an oblong motte in the S. and
an outer enclosure on the N., the whole being further
defended by a high counterscarp bank on the W. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
commands a ford over the river Aran. There is no
village attached to it.</p>

<p>*<span class="smcap">Maud&rsquo;s Castle</span>, otherwise Colwyn or Clun.<a name="FNanchor_974" id="FNanchor_974"></a><a href="#Footnote_974" class="fnanchor">[974]</a>&mdash;A
ditched motte with square bailey on the left bank of
the river Edwy, near the village of Forest Colwyn.
The statement that this castle was <i>repaired</i> in 1145
shows that it must have been older than the time of
Maude de Braose, from whom it is generally supposed
to have taken its name. It was rebuilt by Henry III.
in 1231.<a name="FNanchor_975" id="FNanchor_975"></a><a href="#Footnote_975" class="fnanchor">[975]</a></p>

<p>*<span class="smcap">Payn&rsquo;s Castle</span>, otherwise &ldquo;the castle of Elvael.&rdquo;&mdash;First
mentioned in 1196, when it was taken by Rhys
ap Griffith. This is also a motte-castle (and an exceptionally
fine one), placed on a road leading from Kington
in Hereford to Builth. Rebuilt <i>in stone</i> by Henry III.
in 1231.<a name="FNanchor_976" id="FNanchor_976"></a><a href="#Footnote_976" class="fnanchor">[976]</a> (<a href="#Fig_42">Fig. 42</a>.)</p>

<p>*<span class="smcap">Knighton</span>, in Welsh Trefclawdd.&mdash;First mentioned
in the <i>Pipe Roll</i> of 1181. The motte still remains, near
the church. There is another motte just outside the
village, called Bryn y Castell. It may be a siege castle.</p>

<p>*<span class="smcap">Norton.</span>&mdash;First mentioned in the <i>Pipe Roll</i> of 1191.
A motte remains close to the church, and two sides of a
bailey which ran down to the Norton brook.</p>

<p>*<span class="smcap">Bleddfa</span>, the Bledewach of the <i>Pipe Roll</i> of 1195-1196,
when £5 was given to Hugh de Saye <i>ad firmandum
castellum</i>, an expression which may mean either building
or repairing. An oval motte, and traces of a bailey, are
marked in the 6-inch O.M.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tynboeth</span>, <i>alias</i> Dyneneboth, Tinbech,<a name="FNanchor_977" id="FNanchor_977"></a><a href="#Footnote_977" class="fnanchor">[977]</a> and Llan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>anno.&mdash;First
mentioned in <i>Pipe Roll</i> of 1196-1197.
There is a fine large motte in a commanding situation, and
a crescent-shaped bailey, now marked only by a scarp.
There are some remains of masonry, and the castle was
evidently an important one. It is first mentioned in the
<i>Pipe Roll</i> of 1196, and it occurs in lists of the Mortimer
castles in the 14th century.<a name="FNanchor_978" id="FNanchor_978"></a><a href="#Footnote_978" class="fnanchor">[978]</a> It is not far from two
fords of the river Ithon. [H. W.]</p>

<p>These four castles are not mentioned in the <i>Brut y
Tywysogion</i>, though the <i>Annales Cambriæ</i> mentions the
capture of Bleddfa, Knighton, and Norton by the Welsh
in 1262. They all command important roads. Knighton
and Norton were boroughs.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Castles of Glamorganshire.</span></h3>

<p><i>Cardiff</i> (<a href="#Fig_43">Fig. 43</a>).&mdash;The first castle of Cardiff was
certainly a wooden one; its lofty mound still remains.
It is placed inside a Roman station, and the south and
west walls of the castle bailey rest on Roman foundations,
&ldquo;but do not entirely coincide with those foundations.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_979" id="FNanchor_979"></a><a href="#Footnote_979" class="fnanchor">[979]</a>
The Roman fort was probably ruinous when Robert
Fitz Hamon placed his first castle there, as on the N.
and E. sides the bailey is defended by an earthbank, in
which the remains of a Roman wall have been found
buried. The area of the Roman Castrum was about 8&frac14;
acres, and evidently the Normans found this too large,
as they divided it by a cross wall, which reduces the
inner fort to about 2 acres. The motte has its own
ditch. The position of Cardiff was a very important
base, not only as a port near Bristol, but as a point on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
the probably Roman road which connected Gloucester
with Carmarthen and beyond.<a name="FNanchor_980" id="FNanchor_980"></a><a href="#Footnote_980" class="fnanchor">[980]</a></p>

<p>The lands of Robert Fitz Hamon, in the next
generation, passed into the hands of Robert, the great
Earl of Gloucester, Henry I.&rsquo;s illegitimate son. He was
a great castle-builder, and it is probable that the first
masonry of Cardiff Castle was his work.<a name="FNanchor_981" id="FNanchor_981"></a><a href="#Footnote_981" class="fnanchor">[981]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Newcastle Bridgend.</span>&mdash;This castle and the three
which follow are all situated on or near the &ldquo;Roman&rdquo;
road from Cardiff to St David&rsquo;s, of which we have already
spoken. There were two castles at Bridgend, the Old
Castle and the New Castle, from which the town takes
its name. The site of the former is now too much cut
up for any definite conclusions about it; the site of the
latter has been converted into market gardens, but a
motte is still standing in one corner with the ruins of a
tower upon it. [H. W.] This castle is not noticed either
by the <i>Brut</i> or the Aberpergwm version; the earliest
mention known to us is in the <i>Pipe Roll</i> of 1184, at a
time when the castles of the Earl of Gloucester were in
royal custody, and this appears to have been one of
them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kenfig.</span>&mdash;This castle is close to the &ldquo;Roman&rdquo; road.
The Aberpergwm <i>Brut</i> says that it was one of the castles
of Robert Fitz Hamon, and states that in 1092 it was
rebuilt &ldquo;stronger than ever before, for castles prior to
that were built of wood.&rdquo; This is a good specimen of
the mixture of truth and error to be found in this 16th
century MS. There is little doubt that all the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
castles of the Normans in Wales were built of wood;
but it is extremely unlikely that any wooden keep was
replaced by a stone one as early as 1092. The town
and castle of Kenfig are now almost entirely buried in
sand-drifts, but the top of the motte, with some fragments
of masonry upon it, is still visible. [H. W.]<a name="FNanchor_982" id="FNanchor_982"></a><a href="#Footnote_982" class="fnanchor">[982]</a> The
note in the <i>Pipe Rolls</i> of the repair of the <i>palicium</i> of
this castle shows that the bailey wall at any rate was
still of wood in 1183. Even as late as 1232 the keep
was only defended by a ditch and hedge; yet it withstood
an assault from Llywelyn ap Jorwerth.<a name="FNanchor_983" id="FNanchor_983"></a><a href="#Footnote_983" class="fnanchor">[983]</a> The
bailey is said to contain 11 acres, a most unusual
size. Kenfig was a borough in Norman times, and it is
possible that this large bailey was the original borough,
afterwards enlarged in mediæval times. There is
evidence that there were burgage tenements within the
bailey.<a name="FNanchor_984" id="FNanchor_984"></a><a href="#Footnote_984" class="fnanchor">[984]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aberavon.</span>&mdash;The Aberpergwm MS. says that Fitz
Hamon gave Aberavon to the son of the Welsh traitor
who had called him into Glamorgan. At a later period,
however, we find it in Norman hands. The site of the
castle has been entirely cleared away, but it had a motte,
which is still remembered by the older inhabitants.
[H. W.]<a name="FNanchor_985" id="FNanchor_985"></a><a href="#Footnote_985" class="fnanchor">[985]</a> It is not mentioned in the <i>Brut</i> before 1152,
when it was attacked and burnt by Rhys ap Griffith.</p>

<p>*<span class="smcap">Neath.</span>&mdash;The site of the first castle of Neath was
given by Richard de Granville, its owner, to the abbey
of Neath, which he had founded.<a name="FNanchor_986" id="FNanchor_986"></a><a href="#Footnote_986" class="fnanchor">[986]</a> About the year 1111,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
according to the Aberpergwm <i>Brut</i>, Richard returned
from the Holy Land, bringing with him a Syrian
architect, well skilled in the building of monasteries,
churches, and castles, and by him we may presume, a
new castle was built on the other side of the river,
though the present castle on that site is clearly of much
later date. The monks of course destroyed all vestiges
of the first (probably wooden) castle.</p>

<p>*<span class="smcap">Remmi</span>, or Remni.&mdash;Of this castle there is only one
solitary mention, in the <i>Pipe Roll</i> of 1184. The name
seems to indicate the river Rhymney, which is the
boundary between Glamorgan and Monmouth. We are
unable to find any castle site so near the Rhymney as
Ruperra, where Clark mentions a fine motte.<a name="FNanchor_987" id="FNanchor_987"></a><a href="#Footnote_987" class="fnanchor">[987]</a> But we
do not venture on this identification without further
information.<a name="FNanchor_988" id="FNanchor_988"></a><a href="#Footnote_988" class="fnanchor">[988]</a></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Castles of Gower.</span></h3>

<p>*<span class="smcap">Swansea</span>, or Abertawy.&mdash;This was the castle of
Henry Beaumont, the conqueror of Gower. The
present castle is comparatively modern. It is inside the
town; but there used to be a moated mound outside the
town, which was only removed in 1804. It seems
probable to us that this was the original castle of
Beaumont.<a name="FNanchor_989" id="FNanchor_989"></a><a href="#Footnote_989" class="fnanchor">[989]</a> That this first castle had a motte is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
suggested by the narrative in the <i>Brut</i> which tells how
Griffith ap Rhys burnt the outworks in 1115, but was
unable to get at the tower.<a name="FNanchor_990" id="FNanchor_990"></a><a href="#Footnote_990" class="fnanchor">[990]</a></p>

<p>*<span class="smcap">Loughor</span>, or Aberllychor (<a href="#Fig_43">Fig. 43</a>).&mdash;Also built by
Henry Beaumont. The mound of the castle still
remains, with a small square keep on top. There was
formerly a shell wall also. The place of a bailey was
supplied by a terrace 15 feet wide.<a name="FNanchor_991" id="FNanchor_991"></a><a href="#Footnote_991" class="fnanchor">[991]</a> The four castles
last mentioned are all at the mouths of rivers, as well as
on an ancient (if not Roman) coast road.</p>

<p>*<span class="smcap">Llandeilo Talybont</span>, or Castell Hu.&mdash;Only
mentioned once in the <i>Brut</i>, under 1215, as the castle
of Hugh de Miles. A moated mound with a square
bailey and no masonry still remains.<a name="FNanchor_992" id="FNanchor_992"></a><a href="#Footnote_992" class="fnanchor">[992]</a> It commands
the river Loughor, which is still navigable up to that
point at high tides.<a name="FNanchor_993" id="FNanchor_993"></a><a href="#Footnote_993" class="fnanchor">[993]</a> On the opposite side of the river
is another motte and bailey, called Ystum Enlle.
Possibly there was a ford or ferry at this point, which
these castles were placed to defend.<a name="FNanchor_994" id="FNanchor_994"></a><a href="#Footnote_994" class="fnanchor">[994]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oystermouth</span>, a corruption of Ystum Llwynarth.&mdash;First
mentioned in the older <i>Brut</i> in 1215, when it was
burnt by Rhys Grug. The later version says it was
built by Beaumont in 1099. The castle stands on a
natural height, fortified artificially by a motte, which is
of great size. There is a small bailey below to the
N.E., and a curious small oval embankment thrown out
in the rear of the castle towards the N.W. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
architecture of this magnificent castle is all of the
Edwardian style, and as the castle was burnt down by
Rhys ap Meredith in 1287, it is probable that only
wooden structures stood on this site until after that date.
The castle is in a fine situation overlooking the Bay of
Swansea. [H. W.]</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We have now completed our list of the Norman
castles built in Wales which are known to history. It
must not be supposed, however, that we imagine this to
be a complete list of all the Norman castles which were
ever erected in Wales. The fact that several in our
catalogue are only once mentioned in the records makes
it probable that there were many others which have
never been mentioned at all. In this way we may
account for the many mottes which remain in Wales
about which history is entirely silent. As there was
scarcely a corner in Wales into which the Normans did
not penetrate at some time or other, it is not surprising
if we find them in districts which are generally reckoned
to be entirely Welsh. But there is another way of
accounting for them; some of them may have been
built by the Welsh themselves, in imitation of the
Normans. As the feudal system and feudal ideas
penetrated more and more into Wales, and the Welsh
princes themselves became feudal homagers of the kings
of England, it was natural that the feudal castle should
also become a Welsh institution, especially as it was
soon found to be a great addition to the chieftain&rsquo;s
personal strength. The following castles are stated in
the <i>Brut</i> to have been built by the Welsh.<a name="FNanchor_995" id="FNanchor_995"></a><a href="#Footnote_995" class="fnanchor">[995]</a></p>

<p>1113. *<span class="smcap">Cymmer</span>, in Merioneth.&mdash;Built by Uchtred ap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
Edwin, whose name, as we have already remarked,
suggests an English descent. Near Cymmer Abbey
the motte or <i>tomen</i> remains.</p>

<p>*<span class="smcap">Cynfael</span>, in Merioneth, near Towyn.&mdash;Built by
Cadwalader, son of Griffith ap Cynan, on whose behalf
Henry II. undertook his first expedition into Wales,
and who was at that time a protégé of the Anglo-Normans.
Clark gives a plan of this motte-castle in
<i>Arch. Camb.</i>, 4th ser., vi., 66.</p>

<p>1148. *<span class="smcap">Yale</span>, in Denbigh = Llanarmon.&mdash;Said to
have been built by Owen Gwynedd, but here, as we
have said, an earlier Norman foundation seems probable
(see <a href="#Page_272">p. 272</a>).</p>

<p>1148. <span class="smcap">Llanrhystyd</span>, in Cardigan.&mdash;Also built by
Cadwalader, who was then establishing himself in
Cardigan. Probably the motte and bailey called
Penrhos, or Castell Rhos, to the east of Llanrhystyd
village. [H. W.]</p>

<p>1155. <span class="smcap">Aberdovey.</span>&mdash;Built by Rhys ap Griffith to
defend Cardigan against Owen, Prince of Gwynedd. It
must therefore have been on the Cardigan shore of the
Dovey, and not at the present town of Aberdovey,
which is on the Merioneth shore. And in fact, on the
Cardigan shore of the estuary, about two miles west of
Glandovey Castle, there is a tumulus called Domenlas
(the green tump), which was very likely the site of this
castle of Rhys.<a name="FNanchor_996" id="FNanchor_996"></a><a href="#Footnote_996" class="fnanchor">[996]</a></p>

<p>1155. <span class="smcap">Caereinion.</span>&mdash;Built by Madoc of Powys, who
was then a homager of Henry II. Remains of a motte
near the church; the churchyard itself appears to be the
former bailey. About a mile off is a British camp called
Pen y Voel, which <i>may</i> have been the seat of the son of
Cunedda, who is said to have settled here. [H. W.]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span></p>

<p>*<span class="smcap">Walwern</span>, or Tafolwern, near Llanbrynmair, in
Montgomery, may have been a Welsh castle. It is first
mentioned in 1163, when Howel ap Jeuav took it from
Owen Gwynedd, who may have been its builder. The
motte is marked in the O.M. on a narrow peninsula at
the junction of two streams.</p>

<p>1169. *<span class="smcap">Abereinon</span>, in Cardigan.&mdash;Built by Rhys ap
Griffith, Henry II.&rsquo;s Justiciar of South Wales. &ldquo;A
circular moated tumulus, now called Cil y Craig.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_997" id="FNanchor_997"></a><a href="#Footnote_997" class="fnanchor">[997]</a> (It
is marked on the 25-inch O.M.)</p>

<p>1177. *<span class="smcap">Rhaidr Gwy.</span>&mdash;Also built by Rhys ap Griffith,
no doubt as a menace to Powys, as this castle was
afterwards sorely contested. It is a motte-and-bailey
castle, the motte being known as Tower Mount.<a name="FNanchor_998" id="FNanchor_998"></a><a href="#Footnote_998" class="fnanchor">[998]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>All these castles are of the motte-and-bailey type, and
prove the adoption by the Welsh of Norman customs.<a name="FNanchor_999" id="FNanchor_999"></a><a href="#Footnote_999" class="fnanchor">[999]</a>
It will be noticed that in the first instances they were
built by men who were specially under Norman influences.
But probably the fashion was soon more widely followed,
although these are the only recorded cases.</p>

<p>The contribution made by the castles of Wales to
the general theory of the origin of mottes in these
islands is very important. Leaving out the seven
castles attributed to the Welsh, we find that out of
seventy-one castles built by the Normans, fifty-three, or
very nearly three-fourths, still have mottes; while in the
remaining eighteen, either the sites have been so altered
as to destroy the original plan, or there is a probability
that a motte has formerly existed.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br />
<span class="smaller">MOTTE-CASTLES IN SCOTLAND</span></h2>

<p>The Scottish historians of the 19th century have amply
recognised the Anglo-Norman occupation of Scotland,
which took place in the 11th and 12th centuries, ever
since its extent and importance were demonstrated by
Chalmers in his <i>Caledonia</i>. Occupation is not too
strong a word to use, although it was an occupation
about which history is strangely silent, and which
seems to have provoked little resistance except in
the Keltic parts of the country. But it meant the
transformation of Scotland from a tribal Keltic kingdom
into an organised feudal state, and in the
accomplishment of this transformation the greater
part of the best lands in Scotland passed into the
hands of English refugees or Norman and Flemish
adventurers.</p>

<p>The movement began in the days of Malcolm
Canmore, when his English queen, the sainted Margaret,
undoubtedly favoured the reception of English refugees
of noble birth, some of whom were her own relations.<a name="FNanchor_1000" id="FNanchor_1000"></a><a href="#Footnote_1000" class="fnanchor">[1000]</a>
Very soon, the English refugees were followed by
Norman refugees, who had either fallen under the
displeasure of the king of England, like the Mont<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>gomeries,
or were the cadets of some Norman family,
wishful to carve out fresh fortunes for themselves, like
the Fitz Alans, the ancestors of the Stuarts. The
immigration continued during the reign of the sons of
Margaret, but seems to have reached its culminating
point under David I. (1124-1153).</p>

<p>David, as Burton remarks, had lived for sixteen
years as an affluent Anglo-Norman noble, before his
accession to the Scottish crown, being Earl of Huntingdon
in right of his wife, the daughter of Simon de
Senlis, and granddaughter, through her mother, of Earl
Waltheof. David&rsquo;s tastes and sympathies were Norman,
but it was not taste alone which impelled him to build
up in Scotland a monarchy of the Anglo-Norman feudal
type. He had a distinct policy to accomplish; he
wished to do for Scotland what Edward I. sought to
do for the whole island, to unite its various nationalities
under one government, and he saw that men of the
Anglo-Norman type would be the best instruments of
this policy.<a name="FNanchor_1001" id="FNanchor_1001"></a><a href="#Footnote_1001" class="fnanchor">[1001]</a> It mattered little to him from what nation
he chose his followers, if they were men who accepted
his ideas. Norman, English, Flemish, or Norse
adventurers were all received at his court, and endowed
with lands in Scotland, if they were men suitable for
working the system which he knew to be the only one
available for the accomplishment of his policy. And
that system was the feudal system. He saw that
feudalism meant a higher state of civilisation than
the tribalism of Keltic Scotland, and that only
by the complete organisation of feudalism could
he carry out the unification of Scotland, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
subjugation of the wild Keltic tribes of the north and
west.<a name="FNanchor_1002" id="FNanchor_1002"></a><a href="#Footnote_1002" class="fnanchor">[1002]</a></p>

<p>The policy was successful, though it was not completely
carried out until Alexander III. purchased the
kingdom of the Isles from the King of Norway in 1266.
The sons of David, Malcolm IV., and William the Lion
were strong men who doughtily continued the subjugation
of the Keltic parts of Scotland, and distributed the
lands of the conquered among their Norman or
Normanised followers. The struggle was a severe
one; again and again did the North rebel against the
yoke of the House of Malcolm. In Moray the Keltic
inhabitants were actually driven out by Malcolm
IV., and the country colonised by Normans or
Flemings.<a name="FNanchor_1003" id="FNanchor_1003"></a><a href="#Footnote_1003" class="fnanchor">[1003]</a> The same Malcolm led no less than three
expeditions against Galloway, where in spite of extensive
Norse settlements on the coast, the mass of the inhabitants
appear to have been Keltic.<a name="FNanchor_1004" id="FNanchor_1004"></a><a href="#Footnote_1004" class="fnanchor">[1004]</a></p>

<p>We know very little about the details of this remarkable
revolution, because Scotland had no voice in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
12th century, none of her chroniclers being earlier than
the end of the 14th century. As regards the subject
which concerns this book, the building of castles, there
are only one or two passages which lift the veil. A
contemporary English chronicler, Ailred of Rievaulx, in
his panegyric of David I., says that David decorated
Scotland with castles and cities.<a name="FNanchor_1005" id="FNanchor_1005"></a><a href="#Footnote_1005" class="fnanchor">[1005]</a> In like manner
Benedict of Peterborough tells us that when William
the Lion was captured by Henry II.&rsquo;s forces in 1174,
the men of Galloway took the opportunity to destroy all
the castles which the king had built in their country,
expelling his seneschals and guards, and killing all the
English and French whom they could catch.<a name="FNanchor_1006" id="FNanchor_1006"></a><a href="#Footnote_1006" class="fnanchor">[1006]</a> Fordun
casually mentions the building of two castles in Ross by
William the Lion; and once he gives us an anecdote
which is a chance revelation of what must have been
going on everywhere. A certain English knight,
Robert, son of Godwin, whose Norman name shows
that he was one of the Normanised English, tarried
with the king&rsquo;s leave on an estate which King Edgar
had given him in Lothian, <i>and while he was seeking to
build a castle there</i>, he was attacked by the men of
Bishop Ranulf of Durham, who objected to a castle
being built so near the English frontier.<a name="FNanchor_1007" id="FNanchor_1007"></a><a href="#Footnote_1007" class="fnanchor">[1007]</a></p>

<p>But even if historians had been entirely silent about
the building of castles in Scotland, we should have been
certain that it must have happened, as an inevitable
part of the Norman settlement. Robertson remarks
that the Scots in the time of David I. were still a
pastoral and in some respects a migratory people, their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
magnates not residing like great feudal nobles in their
own castles, but moving about from place to place, and
quartering themselves upon the dependent population.
There is in fact no reason for supposing that the Keltic
chiefs of Scotland built castles, any more than those of
Wales or Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_1008" id="FNanchor_1008"></a><a href="#Footnote_1008" class="fnanchor">[1008]</a> But the feudal system must very
soon have covered Scotland with castles.</p>

<p>The absence of any stone castles of Norman type
has puzzled Scottish historians, whose ideas of castles
were associated with buildings in stone.<a name="FNanchor_1009" id="FNanchor_1009"></a><a href="#Footnote_1009" class="fnanchor">[1009]</a> In 1898 Dr
Christison published his valuable researches into the
<i>Early Fortifications of Scotland</i>, in which for the first
time an estimate was attempted of the distribution of
Scottish <i>motes</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1010" id="FNanchor_1010"></a><a href="#Footnote_1010" class="fnanchor">[1010]</a> and their Norman origin almost, if not
quite, suspected. His book was quickly followed by
Mr George Neilson&rsquo;s noteworthy paper on the &ldquo;Motes
in Norman Scotland,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_1011" id="FNanchor_1011"></a><a href="#Footnote_1011" class="fnanchor">[1011]</a> in which he showed that the
wooden castle is the key which unlocks the historians&rsquo;
puzzle, and that the motes of Scotland are nothing but
the evidence of the Norman feudal settlement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span></p>

<p>Two important points urged in Mr Neilson&rsquo;s paper
are the feudal and legal connection of these motes. He
has given a list of mottes which are known to have been
the site of the &ldquo;chief messuages&rdquo; of baronies in the
13th and 14th centuries, and has collected the names of
a great number which were seats of justice, or places
where &ldquo;saisine&rdquo; of a barony was taken, not because
they were moot-hills, but because the administration of
justice remained fixed in the ancient site of the baron&rsquo;s
castle. &ldquo;The doctrine of the chief messuage, which
became of large importance in peerage law, made it at
times of moment to have on distinct record the nomination
of what the chief messuage was, often for the
imperative function of taking <i>sasine</i>. In many instances
the <i>caput baroniæ</i>, or the court or place for the ceremonial
entry to possession, is the &lsquo;$1&rsquo;moit,&rsquo; the &lsquo;mothill,&rsquo;
the &lsquo;auld castell,&rsquo; the &lsquo;auld wark,&rsquo; the &lsquo;castellsteid,&rsquo;
the &lsquo;auld castellsteid,&rsquo; the &lsquo;courthill,&rsquo; or in Latin <i>mons
placiti</i>, <i>mons viridis</i>, or <i>mons castri</i>.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_1012" id="FNanchor_1012"></a><a href="#Footnote_1012" class="fnanchor">[1012]</a> In certain places
where two mottes are to be found, he was able to prove
that two baronies had once had their seats. Another
point which Mr Neilson worked out is the relation of
bordlands to mottes. Bordland or borland, though an
English word, is not pre-Conquest; it refers to &ldquo;that
species of demesne which the lord reserves for the supply
of his own table.&rdquo; It is constantly found in the near
proximity of mottes.<a name="FNanchor_1013" id="FNanchor_1013"></a><a href="#Footnote_1013" class="fnanchor">[1013]</a></p>

<p>The following is a list of thirty-eight Anglo-Norman
or Normanised adventurers settled in Scotland, on
whose lands mottes are to be found. The list must
be regarded as a tentative one, for had all the names
given by Chalmers been included, it would have been
more than doubled. But the difficulties of obtain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>ing
topographical information were so great that
it has been judged expedient to give only the
names of those families who are known to have held
lands, and in most cases to have had their principal
residences, in places where mottes are or formerly were
existing.<a name="FNanchor_1014" id="FNanchor_1014"></a><a href="#Footnote_1014" class="fnanchor">[1014]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anstruther.</span>&mdash;William de Candela obtained the lands
of Anstruther, in Fife, from David I. His descendants
took the surname of Anstruther. The &ldquo;Mothlaw&rdquo; of
Anstruther is mentioned in 1590.<a name="FNanchor_1015" id="FNanchor_1015"></a><a href="#Footnote_1015" class="fnanchor">[1015]</a> &ldquo;At the W. end of
the town there is a large mound, called the Chester Hill,
in the middle of which is a fine well.&rdquo; (N. S. A., 1845.)
The well is an absolute proof that this was the site of a
castle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Avenel.</span>&mdash;Walter de Avenel held Abercorn Castle
and estate, in Linlithgow, in the middle of the 12th
century. The castle stood on a green mound (N. S. A.)
which is clearly marked in the O.M.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Balliol.</span>&mdash;The De Bailleul family had their seat at
Barnard Castle, in Durham, after the Conquest. They
obtained lands in Galloway from David I., and had strongholds
at Buittle, and Kenmure, in Kirkcudbright. At
Buittle the site of the castle exists, a roughly triangular
bailey with a motte at one corner;<a name="FNanchor_1016" id="FNanchor_1016"></a><a href="#Footnote_1016" class="fnanchor">[1016]</a> and at Kenmure the
O.M. clearly shows a motte, as does the picture in Grose&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
<i>Antiquities of Scotland</i>. The terraces probably date
from the time when the modern house on top was
built.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Barclay.</span>&mdash;The De Berkeleys sprang from the De
Berkeleys of England, and settled in Scotland in the
12th century. Walter de Berkeley was Chamberlain of
Scotland in 1165; William the Lion gave him the manor
of Inverkeilor, in Forfarshire; there he built a castle, on
Lunan Bay. &ldquo;An artificial mound on the west side of
the bay, called the Corbie&rsquo;s Knowe, bears evident marks
of having been a castle long previous to the erection of
Redcastle.&rdquo; (N. S. A.) The family also had lands in
what is now Aberdeenshire, and at Towie, in the parish
of Auchterless, they had a castle. &ldquo;Close to the church
of Auchterless there is a small artificial eminence of
an oval shape, surrounded by a ditch, which is now in
many places filled up. It still retains the name of the
Moat Head, and was formerly the seat of the baronial
court.&rdquo; (N. S. A.; N.; C.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bruce.</span>&mdash;The De Brus held lands in North Yorkshire
at the time of the Domesday Survey. David I. gave
them the barony of Annan, in Dumfriesshire. The
original charter of this grant still exists in the British
Museum, witnessed by a galaxy of Norman names.<a name="FNanchor_1017" id="FNanchor_1017"></a><a href="#Footnote_1017" class="fnanchor">[1017]</a>
Their chief castles were at Annan and Lochmaben.
At Annan, near the site of a later castle, there is still
a motte about 50 feet high, with a vast ditch and some
traces of a bailey (N.), called the Moat (N. S. A.).
The &ldquo;terras de Moit et Bailyis, intra le Northgate,&rdquo;
are mentioned in 1582. South of the town of Lochmaben,
on the N.W. side of the loch, is a fine
motte called Castle Hill, with some remains of masonry,
which is still pointed out as the original castle of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
Bruces.<a name="FNanchor_1018" id="FNanchor_1018"></a><a href="#Footnote_1018" class="fnanchor">[1018]</a> (G.) The fine motte and bailey at Moffat
must also have been one of their castles, as Moffat was
one of their demesne lands. (<a href="#Fig_44">Fig. 44</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cathcart.</span>&mdash;Name territorial. Rainald de Cathcart
witnesses a charter (in the Paisley Register) in 1179.
Near the old castle of Cathcart, Lanark, is &ldquo;an eminence
called Court Knowe.&rdquo; (N. S. A.) As Mr Neilson has
shown, these court knowes and court hills are generally
disused mottes. The name Rainald is clearly Norman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cheyne.</span>&mdash;This family is first known in 1258, but
had then been long settled in Scotland, and were
hereditary sheriffs of Banffshire. Chalmers only mentions
their manor of Inverugie, in Aberdeenshire. Behind
the ruins of Inverugie Castle rises a round flat-topped
hill, which was the Castle Hill or Mote Hill of former
days. (N. S. A.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colville.</span>&mdash;Appears in Scotland in the reign of
Malcolm IV., holding the manors of Heton and Oxnam,
in Roxburgh. About &frac14; mile from Oxnam (which was a
barony) is a moated mound called Galla Knowe. (O.M.,
C., and N.) Hailes identified the castle in Teviotdale,
captured and burnt by Balliol in 1333, with that of
Oxnam.<a name="FNanchor_1019" id="FNanchor_1019"></a><a href="#Footnote_1019" class="fnanchor">[1019]</a> Le Mote de Oxnam is mentioned in 1424 (N.).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cumyn</span>, or <span class="smcap">Comyn</span>.&mdash;The first of this family came to
Scotland as the chancellor of David I.<a name="FNanchor_1020" id="FNanchor_1020"></a><a href="#Footnote_1020" class="fnanchor">[1020]</a> First seated at
Linton Roderick, in Roxburghshire, where there is a
rising ground, surrounded formerly by a foss, the site
of the original castle; (G.) a description which seems to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
suggest a motte. William the Lion gave the Cumyns
Kirkintilloch in Dumbarton, and we afterwards find them
at Dalswinton in Dumfriesshire, and Troqueer in Kirkcudbright.
At Kirkintilloch the O.M. shows a square
mount concentrically placed in a square enceinte. The
enclosure was apparently one of the forts on the wall of
Agricola, but the writer on Kirkintilloch in the N. S. A.
suspected that it had been transformed into a castle by
the Cumyns. At Dalswinton the O.M. shows a motte,
and calls it the &ldquo;site of Cumyn&rsquo;s Castle.&rdquo; At Troqueer,
&ldquo;directly opposite the spot on the other side the river
where Cumyn&rsquo;s Castle formerly stood is a mote of circular
form and considerable height.&rdquo; (N. S. A.) The Cumyn
who held Kirkintilloch in 1201, was made Earl of
Buchan, and held the vast district of Badenoch, or the
great valley of the Spey. The N. S. A. gives many
descriptions of remains in this region which are suggestive
of motte-castles; we can only name the most striking:
Ruthven, &ldquo;a castle reared by the Comyns on a green
conical mound on the S. bank of the Spey, thought to
be partly artificial,&rdquo; now occupied by ruined barracks;
Dunmullie, in the parish of Duthill, where &ldquo;there can be
traced vestiges of a motte surrounded by a ditch, on
which, according to tradition, stood the castle of the
early lords&rdquo;; Crimond, where Cumyn had a castle, and
where there is a small round hill called Castle Hill; and
Ellon, where the Earl of Buchan had his head court,
on a small hill which has now disappeared, but which
was anciently known as the moot-hill of Ellon. Saisin
of the earldom was given on this hill in 1476. (N. S. A.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cunningham.</span>&mdash;Warnebald, who came from the
north of England, was a follower of the Norman, Hugh
de Morville, who gave him the lands of Cunningham, in
Ayrshire, from which the family name was taken. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
the parish of Kilmaurs, which is in the district of
Cunningham, there is a &ldquo;mote,&rdquo; which may have been
the castle of Warnebald; at any rate the original
manor place of Cunningham was in this parish. It is
of course possible that this motte may have been originally
a De Morville castle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span>&mdash;Name territorial; progenitor was a
Fleming, who received lands on the Douglas water, in
Lanark, in the middle of the 12th century. In the park
of Douglas, to the east of the modern castle, is a mound
called Boncastle, but we are unable to state certainly
that it is a motte. Lag Castle, in the parish of
Dunscore, &ldquo;has a moat or court hill a little to the east.&rdquo;
(N. S. A.: shown in Grose&rsquo;s picture.) It must have been
originally Douglas land, as in 1408 it was held by an
armour-bearer of Douglas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Durand.</span>&mdash;Clearly a Norman name, corrupted into
Durham. The family were seated at Kirkpatrick
Durham in the 13th century. There is or was a motte
at Kirkpatrick.<a name="FNanchor_1021" id="FNanchor_1021"></a><a href="#Footnote_1021" class="fnanchor">[1021]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Durward.</span>&mdash;This family was descended from Alan
de Lundin, who was dur-ward or door-keeper to the
king about 1233. They possessed a wide domain in
Aberdeenshire, and had a castle at Lumphanan, where
Edward I. stayed in 1296. There is a round motte in
the Peel Bog at Lumphanan, surrounded by a moat,
which was fed by a sluice from the neighbouring burn.
There were ruins in masonry on the top some
hundred years ago. The writer of the N. S. A. account
of this place, with remarkable shrewdness, conjectures
that a wooden castle on this mound was the ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
residence of the Durwards, superseded in the 15th
century by a building of stone, and that it has nothing
to do with Macbeth, whose burial-place is said to be a
cairn in the neighbourhood.<a name="FNanchor_1022" id="FNanchor_1022"></a><a href="#Footnote_1022" class="fnanchor">[1022]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fitz Alan.</span>&mdash;This is the well-known ancestor of the
House of Stuart, Walter, a cadet of a great Norman
family in Shropshire, who is said to have obtained lands
in Scotland in Malcolm Canmore&rsquo;s time. Renfrew was
one of his seats, and Inverwick, in Haddington, another.
Renfrew Castle is entirely destroyed, but the description
of the site, on a small hill, ditched round, called Castle
Hill, strongly suggests a motte. The keep of Inverwick
stands on a natural motte of rock.<a name="FNanchor_1023" id="FNanchor_1023"></a><a href="#Footnote_1023" class="fnanchor">[1023]</a> Dunoon was one of
their castles, near to which &ldquo;stood the Tom-a-mhoid, or
Hill of the court of justice&rdquo; (G.), possibly an ancient
motte.<a name="FNanchor_1024" id="FNanchor_1024"></a><a href="#Footnote_1024" class="fnanchor">[1024]</a> Dunoon Castle, however, itself stands on a
motte, partly artificial and partly carved out of a
headland. (N.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fleming.</span>&mdash;There were many Flemings among the
followers of David I., and eventually the name stuck to
their descendants as a surname. Baldwin the Fleming
obtained lands at Biggar, in Lanarkshire. There is a
motte at the west end of the town of Biggar, 36 feet
high. Biggar was the head of a barony. (N. S. A.
and N.) Colban the Fleming settled at Colbantown, now
Covington, Lanarkshire, where there is a motte (N.).
Robert the Fleming has left a well-preserved oblong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
motte at Roberton, in Lanark, which was a barony, and
where the <i>moit</i> was spoken of in 1608. (N.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Graham.</span>&mdash;Came from England under David I., and
received lands in Lothian. A Graham was lord of
Tarbolton, in Ayrshire, in 1335, so it is possible that the
motte at that place, on which stood formerly the chief
messuage of the barony of Tarbolton, was one of their
castles (N. S. A.), but it may have been older.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hamilton.</span>&mdash;It is not certain that the Hamiltons
came to Scotland before 1272. King Robert I. gave
them the barony of Cadzow, Lanark, which had originally
been a royal seat. In Hamilton Park there is a
mote hill, which was the site of the chief messuage of
this barony (N.). It was formerly surrounded by the
town of Hamilton. (N. S. A.) It is of course possible
that this motte may be much older than the Hamiltons,
as the site of an originally royal castle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hay.</span>&mdash;First appears in the 12th century, as butler
to Malcolm IV. The family first settled in Lothian,
where they had lands at Lochorworth. The Borthwick
family, who got this estate by marriage, obtained a
license from James I. about 1430 to build a castle &ldquo;on
the mote of Locherwart,&rdquo; and to this castle they gave
their own name. (N. S. A.) No doubt it was the
original motte of the Hays. King William gave the
Hays the manor of Errol, in Perthshire, which was made
into a barony. Here is or was the mote of Errol,
&ldquo;a round artificial mound about 20 feet high, and 30
feet in diameter at the top; the platform at the top
surrounded with a low turf wall, and the whole enclosed
with a turf wall at the base, in the form of an equilateral
triangle.&rdquo; (N. S. A.; evidently a triangular bailey.) It
is called the Law Knoll, and is spoken of as a <i>fortalicium</i>
in 1546. (N.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lennox.</span>&mdash;The earls of Lennox are descended from
Arkel, an Englishman, who received from Malcolm
Canmore lands in Dumbartonshire. At Catter, near
the Earl&rsquo;s castle, is a large artificial mound.<a name="FNanchor_1025" id="FNanchor_1025"></a><a href="#Footnote_1025" class="fnanchor">[1025]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lockhart.</span>&mdash;Stevenston, in Ayrshire, takes its name
from Stephen Loccard, and Symington, in Lanark, from
his son (?), Simon Loccard. At Stevenson there was
formerly a castle, and there still (1845) is a Castle Hill.
Stevenston was given by Richard Morville to Stephen
Loccard about 1170. (N. S. A.) At Symington there
was formerly a round mound, called Law Hill, at the
foot of the village, but it has been levelled. (N. S. A.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Logan.</span>&mdash;A Robert Logan witnesses a charter of
William the Lion, and appears later as Dominus
Robertus de Logan. The name Robert shows his
Norman origin. At Drumore, near Logan (parish of
Kirkmaiden, Wigton), there was a castle, and there is
still a court hill or mote.<a name="FNanchor_1026" id="FNanchor_1026"></a><a href="#Footnote_1026" class="fnanchor">[1026]</a> Another mote, at Myroch,
in the same parish, is mentioned by Mr Neilson as the
site of the chief messuage of the barony of Logan.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lovel.</span>&mdash;Settled at Hawick, Roxburghshire. The
mote of Hawick, from the picture in Scott&rsquo;s <i>Border
Antiquities</i>, seems to be a particularly fine one.
Hawick was a barony, and Le Moit is mentioned in
1511. (N.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lyle</span>, or <span class="smcap">Lisle</span>.&mdash;The castle of this Norman family
was at Duchal, Renfrewshire. The plan is clearly that
of a motte and bailey, but the motte is of natural
rock.<a name="FNanchor_1027" id="FNanchor_1027"></a><a href="#Footnote_1027" class="fnanchor">[1027]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Male</span>, now <span class="smcap">Melville</span>.&mdash;Settled in Haddingtonshire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
under David I., and called their seat Melville. Melville
Castle is modern. They afterwards obtained by
marriage lands on the Bervie River, in the Mearns.
Dr Christison&rsquo;s map shows a motte near the mouth of
the Bervie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maxwell.</span>&mdash;Maccus, son of Unwin<a name="FNanchor_1028" id="FNanchor_1028"></a><a href="#Footnote_1028" class="fnanchor">[1028]</a> (evidently of
Scandinavian origin), received lands on the Tweed from
David I., and called his seat Maccusville, corrupted into
Maxwell. There is a motte at Maxwell, near Kelso.
(N.) Maxton, in Roxburghshire, takes its name from
him, and there is a motte called Ringley Hall, on the
Tweed, in this parish. (C. and N. S. A.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Montalt</span>, or <span class="smcap">Mowat</span>.&mdash;Robert de Montalto (Mold,
in Flintshire) witnesses a charter of David I. The
family settled in Cromarty. Le Mote at Cromarty is
mentioned in 1470. (N.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Montgomery.</span>&mdash;This family is undoubtedly descended
from some one of the sons of the great Earl
Roger of Shrewsbury, settled in Scotland after the ruin
of his family in England. Robert de Montgomerie
received the manor of Eaglesham, Renfrew, from
Fitz Alan, the High Steward of Scotland. The
principal messuage of this manor was at Polnoon, &frac12;
mile S.E. of Eaglesham. Here Sir John Montgomerie
built the castle of Polnoon about 1388. (N. S. A.)
The O.M. seems to show that the ruins of this castle
stand on a motte, probably the original castle of
Montgomerie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morville.</span>&mdash;Hugh de Morville was a Northamptonshire
baron, the life-long friend of David I.<a name="FNanchor_1029" id="FNanchor_1029"></a><a href="#Footnote_1029" class="fnanchor">[1029]</a> He
founded one of the most powerful families in the south<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
of Scotland, though after three generations their lands
passed to heiresses, and their chief seat is not even
known by name. But Mr Neilson states that Darnhall,
in Peebles, was the head of their &ldquo;Black Barony,&rdquo; and
that there is a motte there. As Hugh de Morville gave
the church of Borgue to Dryburgh Abbey about 1150,
it is probable that the motte at Boreland of Borgue was
one of his castles. The barony of Beith, in Ayr, given
by Richard de Morville to the Abbey of Kilwinning,
has also a motte, which may be reckoned to be the site
of a De Morville castle. Largs, in Ayr, belonged to the
De Morvilles, and has a Castle Hill near the village,
which appears to be a motte. (G.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mowbray.</span>&mdash;This well-known Norman family also
sent a branch to Scotland. Amongst other places,
about which we have no details, they held Eckford, in
Roxburghshire. In this parish, near the ancient
mansion, is an artificial mount called Haughhead Kipp.
(N. S. A.) This seems a possible motte, but its
features are not described.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Murray.</span>&mdash;Freskin the Fleming came to Scotland
under David I., and received from that king lands in
Moray. He built himself a castle at Duffus, in Elgin,
which is on the motte-and-bailey plan.<a name="FNanchor_1030" id="FNanchor_1030"></a><a href="#Footnote_1030" class="fnanchor">[1030]</a> The stone
keep now on the motte appears to be of the 14th
century. Freskin&rsquo;s posterity took the name of De
Moravia, or Moray. (<a href="#Fig_44">Fig. 44</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oliphant</span>, or <span class="smcap">Olifard</span>.&mdash;Cambuslang, in Lanark,
belonged to Walter Olifard, Justiciary of Lothian in
the time of Alexander II. About a mile E. of the
church is a circular mound 20 feet high. It was here
that the Oliphants&rsquo; castle of Drumsagard formerly
stood. (N. S. A.) Drumsagard was a barony. (N.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">De Quincy.</span>&mdash;Obtained from William the Lion the
manors of Travernant, in East Lothian, and Leuchars,
in Fife. Near the village of Leuchars is a motte with
some slight remains of a stone keep, a deep well in the
centre, and an entrenched bailey, known as the site of
the castle of Leuchars.<a name="FNanchor_1031" id="FNanchor_1031"></a><a href="#Footnote_1031" class="fnanchor">[1031]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ross.</span>&mdash;Godfrey de Ros, a vassal of Richard de
Morville, held of him the lands of Stewarton, in Ayr.
The <i>caput</i> of the lordship was Castletown, where Le
Mote is spoken of in 1451 (N. and C.). The De Ros
were also the first lords of the barony of Sanquhar. A
little lower down the river Nith than the later castle
of Sanquhar is a mote called Ryehill, and a place
anciently manorial. (N.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Somerville.</span>&mdash;William de Somerville was a Norman
to whom David I. gave the manor of Carnwath, in
Lanarkshire. There is a very perfect entrenched motte
at Carnwath (N. S. A. and O.M.), and Le Moit de
Carnwath is mentioned in 1599. (N.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">De Soulis.</span>&mdash;Followed David I. from Northamptonshire
into Scotland, and received Liddesdale, in
Roxburghshire, from him. The motte and bailey of
his original castle still remain, very near the more celebrated
but much later Hermitage Castle.<a name="FNanchor_1032" id="FNanchor_1032"></a><a href="#Footnote_1032" class="fnanchor">[1032]</a> (<a href="#Fig_44">Fig. 44</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Valoignes.</span>&mdash;Philip de Valoignes and his son
William were each successively chamberlains of
Scotland.<a name="FNanchor_1033" id="FNanchor_1033"></a><a href="#Footnote_1033" class="fnanchor">[1033]</a> One of their estates was Easter Kilbride,
in Lanarkshire, where they had a castle. In this parish
is an artificial mount of earth, with an oval area on top,
about &frac14; mile from the present house of Torrance.
(N. S. A.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vaux</span>, or <span class="smcap">De Vallibus</span>.&mdash;Settled in Scotland under
William the Lion. Held the manors of Dirleton and
Golyn, in East Lothian. Dirleton has been transformed
into an Edwardian castle, but from the pictures it
appears to stand on a natural motte of rock. But
about 3 miles from Dirleton the O.M. shows a large
motte called Castle Hill, which may possibly be the
original castle of the De Vaux.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wallace</span>, or <span class="smcap">Wallensis</span>.&mdash;Richard Walensis was
the first of this family, and acquired lands in Ayrshire
in David I.&rsquo;s time. He named his seat Riccardton,
after himself, and the remains of his motte are still
there, a small oval motte called Castle Hill, on which
the church of Riccarton now stands, but which is
recognised as having been a &ldquo;mote hill.&rdquo; (G.)</p>

<p>To this list must be added a number of royal castles
known to have been built in the 12th century, which, as
they were built on mottes, must in the first instance
have been wooden castles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Banff.</span>&mdash;It seems clear that Banff Castle had a
motte, because the doggerel rhymes of Arthur Johnstone
in 1642 say:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">A place was near which was a field until</div>
<div class="i0">Our ancestors did raise it to a hill;</div>
<div class="i0">A stately castle also on it stood.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The <i>Gazetteer</i> says: &ldquo;The citadel occupied a mount,
originally at the end though now near the middle of the
town.&rdquo; The site is still called Castle Hill. (N. S. A.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Crail</span>, Fife.&mdash;The O.M. does not show a motte here.
The N. S. A. says &ldquo;there was a royal residence here,
upon an eminence overlooking the harbour.&rdquo; That this
&ldquo;eminence&rdquo; was a motte seems clear from the <i>Register
of the Great Seal</i>, quoted by Mr Neilson, which speaks
of &ldquo;Le Moitt olim Castrum&rdquo; in 1573.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cupar.</span>&mdash;There seem to be two mottes here, both
raised on a natural &ldquo;esker&rdquo;; the one formerly called
the Castle Hill is now called the School Hill, the school
having been built upon it. The other and higher hill is
called the Moot Hill, and is said to be the place where
the earls of Fife used to dispense justice. (N. S. A.)
Mr Neilson states that both are mentioned in the
<i>Registrum</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dumfries.</span>&mdash;Here there were two mottes, one being
now the site of a church, the other, called Castle Dykes,
a short distance S. of the town, on the opposite side of
the river. Both no doubt were royal castles, and Mr
Neilson has suggested that as an <i>old castlestead</i> is
spoken of in a charter of William the Lion, it implies
that a new castle had recently been built, possibly after
the great destruction of the royal castles in Galloway in
1174.<a name="FNanchor_1034" id="FNanchor_1034"></a><a href="#Footnote_1034" class="fnanchor">[1034]</a> The Castle Dykes appears to be the later castle,
as it is spoken of in the 16th century. (N.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunskeath</span>, Cromarty.&mdash;Built by William the Lion
in 1179. The castle is built on a small <i>moat</i> overhanging
the sea. (G.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elgin.</span>&mdash;Built by William the Lion on a small green
hill called Lady Hill, with conical and precipitous sides.
(N. S. A. and G.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Forfar.</span>&mdash;&ldquo;The castle stood on a round hill to the
N. of the town, and must have been surrounded by
water.&rdquo; (N. S. A.) It was destroyed in 1307. It is
called Gallow Hill in the O.M., and is now occupied by
gasworks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Forres.</span>&mdash;The plan in Chalmers&rsquo; <i>Caledonia</i> clearly
shows a motte, to which the town appears to have
formed a bailey.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inverness.</span>&mdash;Built by David I. when he annexed
Moray. The site is now occupied by a gaol, but the
O.M. shows it to have been a motte, which is clearly
depicted in old engravings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Innermessan.</span>&mdash;As the lands here appear to have
been royal property as late as the time of David II., the
large round motte here may have been an early royal
castle, a conjecture which finds some confirmation in the
name &ldquo;Boreland of Kingston,&rdquo; which Pont places in
the same parish. (N. S. A.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jedburgh.</span>&mdash;Probably built by David I. The site,
which is still called Castle Hill, has been levelled and
completely obliterated by the building of a gaol. Yet
an old plan of the town in 1762, in the possession of the
late Mr Laidlaw of Jedburgh, shows the outline of the
castle to have been exactly that of a motte and bailey,
though, as no hachures are given, it is not absolutely
convincing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kincleven</span>, Perth.&mdash;The O.M. shows no earthworks
connected with the present castle, but on the opposite
side of the river it places a motte called Castle Hill,
which may very likely be the site of the original castle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kirkcudbright.</span>&mdash;Dr Christison marks a motte here,
to the W. of the town. The place is called Castle
Dykes. Mr Coles says it has an oblong central mound
and a much larger entrenched area.<a name="FNanchor_1035" id="FNanchor_1035"></a><a href="#Footnote_1035" class="fnanchor">[1035]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lanark.</span>&mdash;Ascribed traditionally to David I. &ldquo;On
a small artificially shaped hill between the town and the
river, at the foot of the street called Castle Gate, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
still bearing the name of Castle Hill, there stood in
former times beyond all doubt a royal castle.&rdquo; (N. S. A.)
Mr Neilson says, &ldquo;It certainly bears out its reputation
as an artificial mound.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosemarkie</span>, Cromarty.&mdash;Was made a royal burgh by
Alexander II., so the castle must have been originally
royal. &ldquo;Immediately above the town is a mound of
nearly circular form, and level on the top, which seems
to be artificial, and has always been called the Court
Hill.&rdquo; (N. S. A.)</p>

<p>Even if we had no other evidence that motte-castles
were of Norman construction, this list would be very
significant. But taken in connection with the evidence
for the Norman origin of the English, Welsh, and Irish
mottes, it supplies ample proof that in Scotland, as elsewhere,
the Norman and feudal settlement had its
material guarantees in the castles which were planted
all over the land, and that these castles were the simple
structures of earth and wood, whose earthen remains
have been the cause of so much mystification.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br />
<span class="smaller">MOTTE-CASTLES IN IRELAND</span></h2>

<p>In the year 1169, when the first Norman invaders
landed in Ireland, the private castle had been in existence
in England for more than a hundred years, and
had it been suited to the social organisation of the Irish
people, there had been plenty of time for its introduction
into Ireland. Nor are we in a position to deny that
some chieftain with a leaning towards foreign fashions
<i>may</i> have built for himself a castle in the Anglo-Norman
style; all we can say is that there is not the slightest
evidence of such a thing.<a name="FNanchor_1036" id="FNanchor_1036"></a><a href="#Footnote_1036" class="fnanchor">[1036]</a> We have two contemporary
accounts of the Norman settlement in Ireland, the one
given by Giraldus in his <i>Expugnatio Hibernica</i>, and the
Anglo-Norman poem, edited by Mr Goddard H. Orpen,
under the title of the &ldquo;Song of Dermot and the Earl.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_1037" id="FNanchor_1037"></a><a href="#Footnote_1037" class="fnanchor">[1037]</a>
Now Giraldus expressly tells us that the Irish did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
use castles, but preferred to take refuge in their forests
and bogs.<a name="FNanchor_1038" id="FNanchor_1038"></a><a href="#Footnote_1038" class="fnanchor">[1038]</a> The statement is a remarkable one, since
Ireland abounds with defensive works of a very ancient
character; are we to suppose that these were only used
in the prehistoric period? But if castles of the Norman
kind had been in general use in Ireland in the 12th
century, we should certainly hear of their having been
a serious hindrance to the invaders. The history of the
invasion, however, completely confirms the statement of
Giraldus; we never once hear of the Irish defending
themselves in a castle. When they do stand a siege, it
is in a walled town, and a town which has been walled,
not by themselves, but by the Danes, to whom Giraldus
expressly attributes these walls. Moreover, the repeated
insistence of Giraldus on the necessity of systematic
incastellation of the whole country<a name="FNanchor_1039" id="FNanchor_1039"></a><a href="#Footnote_1039" class="fnanchor">[1039]</a> is proof enough that
no such incastellation existed.</p>

<p>It is true that in some of the earliest Irish literature
we hear of the <i>dun</i>, <i>lis</i>, or <i>rath</i> (the words are interchangeable),
which encircled the chieftain&rsquo;s house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span></p>

<p>Many descriptions of royal abodes in Irish poems are
evidently purely fanciful, but underneath the poetical
adornments we can discern the features of the great
wooden hall which appears to have been the residence of
the tribal chieftain, whether Keltic, Norse, or Saxon,
throughout the whole north of Europe in early times.<a name="FNanchor_1040" id="FNanchor_1040"></a><a href="#Footnote_1040" class="fnanchor">[1040]</a>
The thousands of earthen rings, generally called <i>raths</i>,
which are still scattered over Ireland, are believed to be
the enclosures of these kings&rsquo; or chieftains&rsquo; homesteads.
Were they intended for serious military defence? We
are not in a position to answer this question categorically,
but the plans of a number of them which we have
examined do not suggest anything but a very slight
fortification, sufficient to keep off wolves. At all events
we never hear of these raths or duns standing a siege;
the conquering raider comes, sees, and burns.<a name="FNanchor_1041" id="FNanchor_1041"></a><a href="#Footnote_1041" class="fnanchor">[1041]</a> We are
therefore justified in concluding that they did not at all
correspond to what we mean by a private castle. And
most certainly the motte-castle, with its very small
citadel, and its limited accommodation for the flocks and
herds of a tribe, was utterly unsuited to the requirements
of the tribal system.</p>

<p>A good deal of light is thrown on the way in which
Irish chieftains regarded private castles at the time of
the invasion by the well-known story of one who refused
a castle offered him by the invaders, saying that he
preferred a castle of bones to a castle of stones.
Whether legendary or not, it represents the natural
feeling of a man who had been accustomed to sleep
trustfully in the midst of men of his own blood, tied to
him by the bonds of the clan. The clan system in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
Ireland undoubtedly led to great misery through the
absence of a central authority to check the raids of one
clan upon another; but though we occasionally hear of
a chieftain being murdered &ldquo;by his own,&rdquo; we have no
reason to think that clan loyalty was not sufficient, as a
rule, for the internal safety of the community. So that
a popular chieftain might well refuse a fortification
which had every mark of a hateful and suspicious
invader.<a name="FNanchor_1042" id="FNanchor_1042"></a><a href="#Footnote_1042" class="fnanchor">[1042]</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately there is&mdash;or has been until quite
recently&mdash;a strong prejudice in the minds of Irish
antiquaries that works of the motte-and-bailey kind
belong to the prehistoric age of Ireland. Irish scholars
indeed admit that the word <i>mota</i> is not found in any Irish
MS. which dates from before the Norman invasion of
Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_1043" id="FNanchor_1043"></a><a href="#Footnote_1043" class="fnanchor">[1043]</a> We must therefore bear in mind that when
they tell us that such and such an ancient book mentions
the &ldquo;mote&rdquo; at Naas or elsewhere, what they mean is
that it mentions a <i>dun</i>, or <i>rath</i>, or <i>longport</i>, which they
imagine to be the same as a motte. But this is begging
the whole question. There is not the slightest proof
that any of these words meant a motte. <i>Dun</i> is often
taken to mean a hill (perhaps from its resemblance to
Anglo-Saxon <i>dun</i>), but Keltic scholars are now agreed
that it is cognate with the German <i>zaun</i> and Anglo-Saxon
<i>tun</i>, meaning a fenced enclosure.<a name="FNanchor_1044" id="FNanchor_1044"></a><a href="#Footnote_1044" class="fnanchor">[1044]</a> It may be
applied to a fort on a hill, but it may equally well be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
applied to a fort on the flat. <i>Rath</i> is translated <i>fossa</i>
in the <i>Book of Armagh</i>; Jocelin of Furness equates it
with <i>murus</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1045" id="FNanchor_1045"></a><a href="#Footnote_1045" class="fnanchor">[1045]</a> The rath of Armagh was evidently a
very large enclosure in 1166, containing several streets,
houses, and churches, so it was certainly not a motte.<a name="FNanchor_1046" id="FNanchor_1046"></a><a href="#Footnote_1046" class="fnanchor">[1046]</a>
It is of course not impossible that the Normans may
sometimes have occupied an ancient fortified site, but we
may be sure from the considerations already urged that
the fortifications which they erected were of a wholly
different character to the previous ones, even if they
utilised a portion for their bailey.</p>

<p>It is of course difficult to decide in some cases (both
in Ireland and elsewhere) whether a mound which stands
alone without a bailey is a sepulchral tumulus or a
motte. There are some mottes in England and
Scotland which have no baileys attached to them, and
do not appear ever to have had any. In Ireland, the
country of magnificent sepulchral tumuli, it is not
wonderful that the barrow and the motte have become
confused in popular language. It would appear, too, that
there exist in Ireland several instances of artificial
tumuli which were used for the inauguration of Irish
chieftains, and these have occasionally been mistaken for
mottes.<a name="FNanchor_1047" id="FNanchor_1047"></a><a href="#Footnote_1047" class="fnanchor">[1047]</a> As Mr Orpen has shown, there are generally
indications in the unsuitability of the sites, in the
absence of real fortification, or in the presence of
sepulchral signs, to show that these tumuli did not
belong to the motte class. Magh Adair, for example,
which has been adduced as a motte outside the Norman
boundary, is shown by Mr Orpen to be of quite a
different character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span></p>

<p>At many sites in Ireland where the Normans are
known to have built castles at an early period of the
invasion there are no mottes to be seen now. It is
probable that where the Norman conquerors had both
money and time at their disposal they built stone keeps
from the first, and that the motte-castles, with their
wooden towers or <i>bretasches</i>, were built in the times of
stress, or were the residences of the less wealthy under-tenants.
But we know from documents that even in
John&rsquo;s reign the important royal castle of Roscrea was
built with a motte and bretasche,<a name="FNanchor_1048" id="FNanchor_1048"></a><a href="#Footnote_1048" class="fnanchor">[1048]</a> which proves that
this type of castle was still so much esteemed that we
may feel reasonably certain that when Giraldus speaks
of &ldquo;slender defences of turf and stakes&rdquo; he does not
mean motte-castles, but mere embankments and
palisades.<a name="FNanchor_1049" id="FNanchor_1049"></a><a href="#Footnote_1049" class="fnanchor">[1049]</a></p>

<p>But there is another reason for the absence of
mottes from some of the early Norman castle sites.
Those who have examined the castles of Wales know
that it is rare to find a motte in a castle which
has undergone the complete metamorphoses of the
Edwardian<a name="FNanchor_1050" id="FNanchor_1050"></a><a href="#Footnote_1050" class="fnanchor">[1050]</a> period. These new castles had no keeps,
and necessitated an entire change of plan, which led
either to the destruction of the motte or the building of
an entirely new castle on a different site. The removal
of a motte is only a question of spade labour, and many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
sites in England can be pointed out where mottes are
known to have existed formerly, but where now not a
vestige is left.<a name="FNanchor_1051" id="FNanchor_1051"></a><a href="#Footnote_1051" class="fnanchor">[1051]</a> There are many other cases where the
Edwardian castle shows not a trace of any former
earthworks, but where a motte and bailey a little distance
off probably represents the original wooden
castle.<a name="FNanchor_1052" id="FNanchor_1052"></a><a href="#Footnote_1052" class="fnanchor">[1052]</a></p>

<p>The passion for identifying existing earthworks
with sites mentioned in ancient Irish history or
legend has been a most serious hindrance to the
progress of real archæological knowledge in Ireland.
It is not until one begins to look into this matter
that one finds out what giddy guesswork most of
these identifications of Irish place-names really are.
O&rsquo;Donovan was undoubtedly a great Irish scholar,
and his editions of the <i>Book of Rights</i> and the
<i>Annals of the Four Masters</i> are of the highest importance.
The topographical notes to these works
are generally accepted as final. But let us see what
his method was in this part of his labours. In the
<i>Book of Rights</i>, he says very naïvely, about a place
called Ladhrann or Ardladhrann, &ldquo;I cannot find any
place in Wexford according with the notices of this
place except Ardamine, on the sea-coast, where there is
a remarkable <i>moat</i>.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_1053" id="FNanchor_1053"></a><a href="#Footnote_1053" class="fnanchor">[1053]</a> No modern philologist, we think,
would admit that Ardamine could be descended from
Ardladhrann. In the same way O&rsquo;Donovan guessed
Treada-na-righ, &ldquo;the triple-fossed fort of the kings,&rdquo; to
be the motte of Kilfinnane, near Kilmallock. But this
was a pure guess, as he had previously guessed it to be
&ldquo;one of the forts called Dun-g-Claire.&rdquo; To the antiquaries
of that day one earthwork seemed as good as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
another, and differences of type were not considered
important.<a name="FNanchor_1054" id="FNanchor_1054"></a><a href="#Footnote_1054" class="fnanchor">[1054]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The following list of early Norman castles in Ireland
was first published in the <i>Antiquary</i> for 1906. It is an
attempt to form a complete list from contemporary
historians only, that is, from Giraldus Cambrensis and
the &ldquo;Song of Dermot,&rdquo; and from the documents published
in Sweetman&rsquo;s <i>Calendar</i>, of the Norman castles built in
Ireland, up to the end of John&rsquo;s reign.<a name="FNanchor_1055" id="FNanchor_1055"></a><a href="#Footnote_1055" class="fnanchor">[1055]</a> Since then, the
task has been taken up on a far more philosophical plan
by Mr Goddard H. Orpen, whose exceptional knowledge
of the history of the invasion and the families of the
conquerors has enabled him to trace their settlements in
Ireland as they have never been traced before.<a name="FNanchor_1056" id="FNanchor_1056"></a><a href="#Footnote_1056" class="fnanchor">[1056]</a> Nevertheless,
it still seems worth while to republish this list,
as though within a limited compass, consistent with the
writer&rsquo;s limited knowledge, it furnishes an adequate test
of the correctness of the Norman theory, on a perfectly
sound basis. The list has now the advantage of being
corrected from Mr Orpen&rsquo;s papers, and of being
enlarged by identifications which he has been able to
make.<a name="FNanchor_1057" id="FNanchor_1057"></a><a href="#Footnote_1057" class="fnanchor">[1057]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aq&rsquo;i</span> (<i>Cal.</i>, i., 13).&mdash;Unidentified; perhaps an <i>alias</i> for
one of the Limerick castles, as it was certainly in the
county of Limerick.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ardfinnan</span>, Tipperary (<i>Gir.</i>, v., 386).&mdash;Built in 1185,

<p><span class="smcap">Ardmayle</span>, or <span class="smcap">Armolen</span>, Tipperary (<i>Cal.</i>, i., 81).&mdash;A
castle of Theobald Walter. A motte with half-moon
bailey, and earthen wing walls running up its sides,
exactly as stone walls do in later Norman castles.
Ruins of a Perpendicular mansion close to it, and also a
square tower with ogee windows. [B. T. S.] <a href="#Fig_45">Fig. 45</a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ardnurcher</span>, or <span class="smcap">Horseleap</span>, King&rsquo;s Co. (<i>Song of

Henry&rsquo;s, built in 1192.<a name="FNanchor_1059" id="FNanchor_1059"></a><a href="#Footnote_1059" class="fnanchor">[1059]</a> An oblong motte with one
certain bailey, and perhaps a second. No masonry but
the remains of a wall or bridge across the fosse. [B. T. S.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ardree</span>, Kildare (<i>Gir.</i>, v., 356, and <i>Song</i>).&mdash;The
castle built by Hugh de Lacy for Thomas the Fleming
in 1182, was at Ardri, on the Barrow. There is an
artificial mound at Ardree, turned into a graveyard, and
near it a levelled platform above the river, on which
stands Ardree House.<a name="FNanchor_1060" id="FNanchor_1060"></a><a href="#Footnote_1060" class="fnanchor">[1060]</a> On the west bank of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
Barrow, opposite Ardree, is a low circular motte with
ditch and bank, but no bailey. A piece of Norman
pottery with green glaze was found by Mr Stallybrass,
one foot below the surface in the counterscarp bank.
Mr Orpen thinks this motte may have been the castle of
Robert de Bigarz, also mentioned by Giraldus as near
Ardree, on the opposite side of the Barrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Askeaton</span>, or <span class="smcap">Hinneskesti</span>, Limerick.&mdash;Built in
1199, probably by Hamo de Valoignes.<a name="FNanchor_1061" id="FNanchor_1061"></a><a href="#Footnote_1061" class="fnanchor">[1061]</a> An excellent
instance of a motte-and-bailey castle, where the motte
is of natural rock. The splendid keep and hall are of
the 15th century, but there are two older towers, which
might date from 1199. This natural motte has been
identified with the ancient Irish fort of Gephthine
(Askeaton = Eas Gephthine), mentioned in the <i>Book of
Rights</i>. But this work does not mention any <i>fort</i> at
Gephthine, only the place, in a list which is clearly one
of lands (perhaps mensal lands), not of forts, as it
contains many names of plains, and of tribes, as well as
the three isles of Arran.<a name="FNanchor_1062" id="FNanchor_1062"></a><a href="#Footnote_1062" class="fnanchor">[1062]</a></p>

<p>*<span class="smcap">Askelon</span>, or <span class="smcap">Escluen</span> (<i>Cal.</i>, i., 91).&mdash;Castle <i>restored
to</i> Richard de Burgh in 1215; the site is placed by Mr
Orpen at Carrigogunell, which is in the parish of
Kilkeedy, Limerick.<a name="FNanchor_1063" id="FNanchor_1063"></a><a href="#Footnote_1063" class="fnanchor">[1063]</a> Carrigogunell has the ruins of a
castle on a natural motte of rock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span></p>

<p>*<span class="smcap">Athlone</span>, Roscommon (<i>Cal.</i>, i., 80).&mdash;Built in 1210
by the Justiciar, John de Gray. The keep is placed on
a lofty motte, which has been revetted with masonry.
Turlough O&rsquo;Connor built a <i>caislen</i> at Athlone in 1129,
but it was not even on the site of the Norman castle,
for which John obtained land from the church, as already
stated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baginbun</span> (<i>Gir.</i>, i., 13; <i>Song</i>, 1406).&mdash;Mr Orpen has
proved that this was the spot where Raymond le Gros
landed and entrenched himself for four months.<a name="FNanchor_1064" id="FNanchor_1064"></a><a href="#Footnote_1064" class="fnanchor">[1064]</a> It is a
headland on the sea-coast, and headland castles seldom
have mottes, as they were not needed on a promontory
washed on three sides by the sea. Moreover, Baginbun
was of the nature of a temporary fort rather than a
residential castle, and it is to be noted that Giraldus
calls it &ldquo;a poor sort of a castle of stakes and sods.&rdquo;
Still, the small inner area, ditched off with a double
ditch, and the large area, also ditched, roughly correspond
to the motte-and-bailey plan. [B. T. S.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Balimore Eustace</span>, Kildare (<i>Cal.</i>, i., 28).&mdash;A castle
of the Archbishop of Dublin. A motte, with a remarkable
platform attached to one side (<i>cf.</i> Wigmore Castle).
No bailey now; no stone castle. [B. T. S.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caherconlish</span> (Karkinlis, Kakaulis, <i>Cal.</i>, i., 81).&mdash;Castle
of Theobald Fitz Walter. There is nothing left
above ground but a chimney of late date. A few yards
from it is a hillock, which has very much the appearance
of a mutilated motte. [E. S. A.] Mr Orpen, however,
thinks that Theobald&rsquo;s castle may have been at Knockatancashlane,
&ldquo;the hill of the old castle,&rdquo; a townland a
little to the north of Caherconlish.<a name="FNanchor_1065" id="FNanchor_1065"></a><a href="#Footnote_1065" class="fnanchor">[1065]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carbury</span>, Kildare.&mdash;The <i>Song</i> says Meiler Fitz<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
Henry first got Carbury, so the castle was probably his.
It is a motte with two baileys, one of imperfect outline,
the other a curious little half-circle. A 15th-century
castle is built against the side of the motte. [B. T. S.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carlingford</span>, Louth (<i>Cal.</i>, i., 95).&mdash;Apparently a
royal castle (<i>Cal.</i>, i., 156), first mentioned in 1215. It
stands on a rock, which might possibly have been a
former motte. There certainly has been a former castle,
for the present ruin is Edwardian in plan and in every
detail. [E. S. A.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carrick</span>, Wexford (<i>Gir.</i>, v., 245).&mdash;This again seems
to be one of the temporary forts built by the first
invaders (in this case Fitz Stephen), in a strong natural
situation, and Giraldus applies to it the same contemptuous
language as to Baginbun. There is no motte,
but an oval area of 45 yards by 25 is ditched and banked;
a modern imitation of a round tower stands within the
enclosure. [B. T. S.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carrickfergus</span>, Antrim (<i>Cal.</i>, i., 107).&mdash;This was
probably one of the castles built by John de Courcy,
the conqueror of Ulster. The gatehouse and mural
towers are late, but the keep may well be of De Courcy&rsquo;s
time, and furnishes an excellent instance of a castle
on the keep-and-bailey plan, built by the Normans in
stone from the beginning. [E. S. A.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Castletown Delvin</span>, Westmeath (<i>Gir.</i>, v., 356).&mdash;Castle
of Gilbert de Nungent. A motte, with a garden
at base, which may have been the bailey; near it the
stone castle, a keep with round towers at the angles,
probably not as early as John&rsquo;s reign. [B. T. S.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clonard</span>, Meath (<i>Gir.</i>, v., 356).&mdash;Built by Hugh de
Lacy about 1182. A motte, with broad ditch and
curious little oblong bailey; no remains in masonry.
[B. T. S.]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clonmacnoise</span>, King&rsquo;s Co. (<i>Cal.</i>, i., 94).&mdash;First contemporary
mention 1215; the <i>Annals of Loch Cè</i> say it
was built in 1214 &ldquo;by the foreigners.&rdquo; A royal castle.
A large motte with bailey attached; the wing walls of
the bailey run up the motte. The importance of the
castle is shown by the fact that a stone keep was added
not very long after it was built. [B. T. S.]</p>

<p>*<span class="smcap">Collacht</span> (<i>Gir.</i>, v., 355).&mdash;Castle of John of Hereford.
Collacht appears to be a scribal error for Tullaght,
now Tullow, Carlow.<a name="FNanchor_1066" id="FNanchor_1066"></a><a href="#Footnote_1066" class="fnanchor">[1066]</a> The site of the castle is marked
on the 6-inch O.M.; it has been visited by Mr G. H.
Orpen, who found very clear indications of a motte and
bailey. (See <a href="#APPENDIX_L">Appendix L</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Crometh</span> (<i>Cal.</i>, i., 91).&mdash;Castle of Maurice FitzGerald.
Supposed to be Croom, Limerick, though the identification
is by no means certain.<a name="FNanchor_1067" id="FNanchor_1067"></a><a href="#Footnote_1067" class="fnanchor">[1067]</a> There are the ruins of
an Edwardian castle at Croom; no motte. [E. S. A.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Downpatrick</span>, Down (<i>Gir.</i>, v., 345).&mdash;The traveller
approaching Downpatrick sees a number of small hills
which no doubt have once been islands rising out of
the swamps of the Quoyle. On one of these hills stands
the town and its cathedral; on another, to the east, but
separated from the town by a very steep descent and a
brook, stands a motte and bailey of the usual Norman
type. It occupies the whole summit of the small hill, so
that the banks of the bailey are at a great height above
the outer ditch, which is carried round the base of the
hill (compare Skipsea). The motte, which is not a very
large one, has had an earthen breastwork round the top,
now much broken away. Its ditch falls into the ditch
of the bailey, but at a higher level. The bailey is semilunar,
extending round about three-quarters of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
circumference of the motte. There is not the slightest
sign of masonry. As the size of this work has been
greatly exaggerated, it is as well to say that when
measured on the 25-inch O.M. with a planimeter, its
area proves to be 3.9 acres; the area of the motte and
its ditch .9, leaving 3 acres for the bailey. [E. S. A.]
<a href="#Fig_45">Fig. 45</a>.</p>

<p>This thoroughly Norman-French castle, which was
formerly called a Danish fort, has lately been baptised
as Rathceltchair, and supposed to be the work of a
mythical hero of the 1st century <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> Mr Orpen,
however, has disposed of this fancy by showing that the
name Rathceltchair belonged in pre-Norman times to
the enclosure of the ancient church and monastery which
stood on the <i>other</i> hill.<a name="FNanchor_1068" id="FNanchor_1068"></a><a href="#Footnote_1068" class="fnanchor">[1068]</a> We may therefore unhesitatingly
ascribe this motte-castle to John de Courcy, who
first put up a slender fortification within the town walls
to defend himself against temporary attack,<a name="FNanchor_1069" id="FNanchor_1069"></a><a href="#Footnote_1069" class="fnanchor">[1069]</a> but afterwards
built a regular castle, for which this island offered
a most favourable site.<a name="FNanchor_1070" id="FNanchor_1070"></a><a href="#Footnote_1070" class="fnanchor">[1070]</a> A stone castle was built inside
the town at a later period; it is now entirely destroyed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Drogheda</span>, Louth (<i>Cal.</i>, i., 93).&mdash;First mention
1203, but Mr Orpen thinks it probable that it was one
of the castles built by Hugh de Lacy, who died in 1186.
A high motte, with a round and a square bailey, just
outside the town walls;<a name="FNanchor_1071" id="FNanchor_1071"></a><a href="#Footnote_1071" class="fnanchor">[1071]</a> called the Mill Mount in the
time of Cromwell, who occupied it; he mentions that it
had a good ditch, strongly palisadoed.<a name="FNanchor_1072" id="FNanchor_1072"></a><a href="#Footnote_1072" class="fnanchor">[1072]</a> No stone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
castle, though much of the bailey wall remains; a late
martello tower on top of motte. [B. T. S.] <a href="#Fig_45">Fig. 45</a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Duleek</span>, Meath (the castrum Duvelescense of
<i>Giraldus</i>, v., 313).&mdash;Probably first built by Hugh de
Lacy; restored by Raymond le Gros in 1173. The
motte is destroyed, but an old weaver living in the
village in 1906 says that it existed in the time of his
father, who used to roll stones down it in his youth. It
was in the angle between two streams, and there is still
a slight trace of it. No stone castle. [B. T. S.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunamase</span>, Queen&rsquo;s Co. (Dumath, <i>Cal.</i>, i., 100).&mdash;First
mentioned in 1215 as a castle of William
Marshall&rsquo;s, which makes it not unlikely that it was
originally built by Strongbow. The plan of this castle
is the motte-and-bailey plan, but the place of the motte
is taken by a natural rock, isolated by a ditch. There
are three baileys, descending the hill. The stone keep
on the summit is of the 15th or 16th century. [B. T. S.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dungarvan</span>, Waterford (<i>Cal.</i>, i., 89).&mdash;Granted to
Thomas Fitz Antony in 1215. To the west of the town
is a motte called Gallowshill; it has no bailey, but some
trace of a circumvallation. The castle east of the river
is not earlier than the 14th or 15th century. [B. T. S.]</p>

<p>*<span class="smcap">Durrow</span>, King&rsquo;s Co. (<i>Gir.</i>, v., 387).&mdash;A castle of
Hugh de Lacy&rsquo;s; he was murdered while he was building
it, because he had chosen the enclosure of the
church for his bailey.<a name="FNanchor_1073" id="FNanchor_1073"></a><a href="#Footnote_1073" class="fnanchor">[1073]</a> A plan in <i>Journ. R. S. A. I.</i>,
xxix., 227, shows clearly the motte and bailey, though
the writer mistakes for separate mounds what are clearly
broken portions of the vallum. It is possible that the
bailey may have followed the line of the ancient <i>rath</i> of
the church, but it would almost certainly be a much
stronger affair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span></p>

<p>*<span class="smcap">Favorie</span> = <span class="smcap">Fore</span>, Westmeath.&mdash;I owe this identification
to Mr Orpen. As Hugh de Lacy founded or
endowed the monastery at Fore,<a name="FNanchor_1074" id="FNanchor_1074"></a><a href="#Footnote_1074" class="fnanchor">[1074]</a> this was probably one
of his castles, but the first mention is in 1215
(<i>Cal.</i>, i., 95). Mr Westropp mentions the oval motte
of Fore with its bailey in his list of &ldquo;complex motes.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_1075" id="FNanchor_1075"></a><a href="#Footnote_1075" class="fnanchor">[1075]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ferns</span>, Wexford (<i>Gir.</i>, v., 326).&mdash;A castle was built
by Walter the German <i>near</i> Ferns. Ferns is spoken of
as a city in the time of King Dermot. There is no
motte at Ferns; the stone castle has a keep, which is
certainly not earlier than the time of Henry III.
[B. T. S.]</p>

<p>*<span class="smcap">Fotheret Onolan</span>, castle of Raymond le Gros
(<i>Gir.</i>, v., 355).&mdash;Mr Orpen identifies this with Castlemore,
near Tullow, Co. Carlow. There is an oval
motte, and a rectangular bailey with indications of
masonry.<a name="FNanchor_1076" id="FNanchor_1076"></a><a href="#Footnote_1076" class="fnanchor">[1076]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Galtrim</span>, Meath.&mdash;Identified by Mr Orpen with the
castle of Hugh de Hose, or Hussey, mentioned in the
&ldquo;Song of Dermot.&rdquo; Destroyed in 1176; no stone castle.
An oval motte; bailey indistinctly traceable. [B. T. S.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Geashill</span>, King&rsquo;s Co. (<i>Cal.</i>, i., 30).&mdash;Mentioned in
1203 as a castle of William, Earl Marshall. There are
remains of a motte, on which stands a 14th-century keep;
but the whole site has been so pulled about in making
a modern house, drive, and gardens, that nothing more
can be made of the plan. The motte, however, is plain,
though mutilated. [E. S. A.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Granard</span>, Longford (<i>Cal.</i>, i., 95).&mdash;Built by Richard
Tuit in 1199.<a name="FNanchor_1077" id="FNanchor_1077"></a><a href="#Footnote_1077" class="fnanchor">[1077]</a> A magnificent motte, with a very wide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
ditch, and a small fan-shaped bailey. Foundations of
a shell wall round the top of the motte, and of a small
round tower in the centre. [B. T. S.]</p>

<p>*<span class="smcap">Hincheleder</span>, or <span class="smcap">Inchelefyre</span> (<i>Cal.</i>, i, 95).&mdash;Said
by Butler (<i>Notices of Trim Castle</i>, 12) to be Inchleffer,
Meath, a castle of Hugh de Lacy. No further information.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John de Clahull&rsquo;s Castle.</span>&mdash;Mr Orpen believes this
to be Killeshin, Queen&rsquo;s Co., as it corresponds to the
description in the <i>Song</i>, &ldquo;entre Eboy et Lethelyn.&rdquo;
There is a motte there, and traditions of a town.</p>

<p>*<span class="smcap">Karakitel</span>, or <span class="smcap">Carrickittle</span>, Limerick (<i>Cal.</i>, i., 14).&mdash;Castle
of William de Naas in 1199. There was a
remarkable natural motte of rock here, with the foundations
of a castle upon it, now destroyed.<a name="FNanchor_1078" id="FNanchor_1078"></a><a href="#Footnote_1078" class="fnanchor">[1078]</a></p>

<p>*<span class="smcap">Killamlun</span> (<i>Cal.</i>, i., 53).&mdash;Identified by Mr Orpen
with Killallon, Meath, where there is a large motte.
There is a stone passage into this motte, but no
evidence has been brought forward to prove that it is
of the same nature as the prehistoric <i>souterrains</i> so
common in Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_1079" id="FNanchor_1079"></a><a href="#Footnote_1079" class="fnanchor">[1079]</a> In England there is a remarkable
instance at Oxford of a well-chamber built inside a
motte.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Killare</span>, Westmeath (<i>Gir.</i>, v., 356).&mdash;A castle of
Hugh de Lacy, built in 1184;<a name="FNanchor_1080" id="FNanchor_1080"></a><a href="#Footnote_1080" class="fnanchor">[1080]</a> burnt in 1187. A good
motte, with ditch and well-preserved bank on counterscarp;
no bailey. No stone castle. [B. T. S.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kilbixie</span>, Westmeath.&mdash;Identified by Mr Orpen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
with Kelbery, given to Geoffrey de Constantin
(<i>Song</i>, 3154); the castle is mentioned in a charter of
Walter de Lacy, as well as in the <i>Annals of Loch Cè</i>,
which state that it was built in 1192. A motte, with a
broad ditch, and no bailey; but on the W. side the
counterscarp bank of the ditch widens out into a sort of
narrow half-moon terrace. This peculiarity may be
noted in several other Irish castles. Foundations of an
oblong shell on top of motte, and of a small square
tower in the centre of this ward. [B. T. S.]</p>

<p>*<span class="smcap">Kilfeakle</span>, Tipperary (<i>Cal.</i>, i., 29).&mdash;A castle of
William de Burgh. Built in 1193.<a name="FNanchor_1081" id="FNanchor_1081"></a><a href="#Footnote_1081" class="fnanchor">[1081]</a> A motte and
bailey; trace of a stone wing wall down the motte.<a name="FNanchor_1082" id="FNanchor_1082"></a><a href="#Footnote_1082" class="fnanchor">[1082]</a></p>

<p>*<span class="smcap">Kilmehal</span> (<i>Cal.</i>, i., 44).&mdash;Mr Orpen regards the
identification of this castle with Kilmallock as extremely
doubtful.</p>

<p>*<span class="smcap">Kilmore</span> (<i>Cal.</i>, i., 95).&mdash;Restored to Walter de
Lacy in 1215. Identified with Kilmore, near Lough
Oughter, Cavan.<a name="FNanchor_1083" id="FNanchor_1083"></a><a href="#Footnote_1083" class="fnanchor">[1083]</a> Mr Westropp mentions the motte
at this place, which is outside the Anglo-Norman area.
The castle was wrecked in 1225 or 1226, and no more is
heard of it. The Anglo-Norman advance in this
direction failed.</p>

<p>*<span class="smcap">Kilsantan</span>, Londonderry (<i>Cal.</i>, i., 70).&mdash;Built by
John de Courcy in 1197.<a name="FNanchor_1084" id="FNanchor_1084"></a><a href="#Footnote_1084" class="fnanchor">[1084]</a> Now called Kilsandal, or
Mount Sandal, a large motte on the Bann, not far from
Coleraine. The castle of Coleraine, inside the town,
was built in 1214, apparently of stone,<a name="FNanchor_1085" id="FNanchor_1085"></a><a href="#Footnote_1085" class="fnanchor">[1085]</a> and probably
superseded the castle of Kilsandal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kiltinan</span>, Tipperary (<i>Cal.</i>, i., 94).&mdash;Castle of Philip
of Worcester in 1215. No motte; a headland castle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
overhanging a river valley. The castle has not only
undergone a late Edwardian transformation, but has
been cut up to make a modern mansion and farm
buildings. No fosses or earthworks remain. [E. S. A.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knock</span>, or <span class="smcap">Castleknock</span>, Dublin (<i>Cal.</i>, i., 81).&mdash;Castle
of Hugh Tyrrel. An oval motte, walled round
the top, carrying on its edge a smaller motte (with traces
of a ditch) on which stand the ruins of an octagonal
keep. No other bailey; ditch and bank double for more
than half the circumference. [B. T. S.] <a href="#Fig_45">Fig. 45</a>.</p>

<p>*<span class="smcap">Knockgraffan</span>, Tipperary (<i>Cal.</i>, i., 27).&mdash;Castle of
William de Braose in 1202. One of the finest mottes to
be seen anywhere. Built in 1192, at the same time as
the castle of Kilfeakle.<a name="FNanchor_1086" id="FNanchor_1086"></a><a href="#Footnote_1086" class="fnanchor">[1086]</a> The motte is 55 feet high, has
a wide ditch and high counterscarp bank, which is also
carried round the ditch of the &ldquo;hatchet-shaped&rdquo; bailey,
in proper Norman fashion. &ldquo;There are indications of a
rectangular stone building on the flat summit of the
mote, and there are extensive stone foundations in the
bailey.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_1087" id="FNanchor_1087"></a><a href="#Footnote_1087" class="fnanchor">[1087]</a></p>

<p>*<span class="smcap">Lagelachon</span> (<i>Cal.</i>, i., 95).&mdash;Probably Loughan or
Castlekieran, in which parish is the great motte of
Derver.<a name="FNanchor_1088" id="FNanchor_1088"></a><a href="#Footnote_1088" class="fnanchor">[1088]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lea</span>, Queen&rsquo;s Co. (<i>Cal.</i>, i., 30).&mdash;Castle of William,
Earl Marshall, in 1203. A motte with two baileys;
motte entirely occupied, and partly mutilated by a
13th-century keep, with two large roundels. [B. T. S.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leighlin</span>, Carlow.&mdash;Mr Orpen has shown that the
fine motte of Ballyknockan answers to the description<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
given by Giraldus of the site of the castle of Lechlin
built by Hugh de Lacy.<a name="FNanchor_1089" id="FNanchor_1089"></a><a href="#Footnote_1089" class="fnanchor">[1089]</a> There is a trace of a possible
bailey. The stone castle called Black Castle at
Leighlin Bridge is of very late date. Those who
believe that we have authentic history of Ireland in the
3rd century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> will be able to believe with Dr Joyce
that the description of the annalists identifies this motte
with the site of the ancient palace of Dinn Righ, burnt
by the chieftain Maen at that date! [B. T. S.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lismore</span>, Waterford (<i>Gir.</i>, i., 386).&mdash;About a quarter
of a mile from Lismore, above a ford of the river, is an
excellent specimen of a Norman motte and bailey, called
the Round Hill. The name of the prehistoric fort of
Dunsginne has lately been applied to it, but purely by
guesswork.<a name="FNanchor_1090" id="FNanchor_1090"></a><a href="#Footnote_1090" class="fnanchor">[1090]</a> The <i>Song</i> says that Henry II. intended
to build a castle at Lismore, and that it knows not why
he put it off. Possibly he may have placed these earthworks
here, and never added the wooden castle, or else
this is the site of the castle which was built by his son
John in 1185. The castle inside the town is certainly
later than the time of John, as although much modernised
it is clearly Edwardian in plan. The Norman
fragments incorporated in the walls probably belonged to
the abbey of St Carthagh, on the site of which the
town castle is said to have been built. The so-called
King John&rsquo;s Tower is only a mural tower, not a keep.
[B. T. S.]</p>

<p>*<span class="smcap">Louth</span>, or <span class="smcap">Luveth</span> (<i>Cal.</i>, i., 30).&mdash;A royal castle in
1204, but it must have been in existence as early as
1196, when the town and castle of Louth were burnt by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
Niall MacMahon.<a name="FNanchor_1091" id="FNanchor_1091"></a><a href="#Footnote_1091" class="fnanchor">[1091]</a> This was probably the &ldquo;Fairy
Mount&rdquo; at Louth, of which a plan is given in Wright&rsquo;s
<i>Louthiana</i>. This plan shows &ldquo;the old town trench,&rdquo;
starting from opposite sides of the motte, so that the
castle stood on the line of the town banks. The motte
was ditched and banked round, but the plan does not
show any bailey or any entrance.</p>

<p>*<span class="smcap">Loske</span> (<span class="smcap">Cal.</span>, i., 30).&mdash;Mr Orpen has pointed out to
the writer that this cannot be Lusk, which was a castle
of the Archbishop of Dublin, while Loske belonged to
Theobald Walter, and is not yet identified.</p>

<p>*<span class="smcap">Loxhindy</span> (<i>Cal.</i>, i., 95).&mdash;Mr Orpen identifies this
name with Loughsendy, or Ballymore Loughsendy,
Westmeath, where there is a motte.<a name="FNanchor_1092" id="FNanchor_1092"></a><a href="#Footnote_1092" class="fnanchor">[1092]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Naas</span>, Kildare (<i>Gir.</i>, v., 100).&mdash;The <i>dun</i> of Naas is
mentioned in the <i>Book of Rights</i>, p. 251, and in the
<i>Tripartite Life of St Patrick</i>. By the <i>Dindsenchas</i> it
is attributed to the legendary Princess Tuiltinn in 277
<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> On this &ldquo;evidence&rdquo; the motte at Naas has been
classed as prehistoric. But as we have seen, a <i>dun</i> does
not mean a motte, or even a hill, but an enclosure.
Naas was part of the share which fell to the famous
Anglo-Norman leader, Maurice FitzGerald, and the
earthworks are quite of the Norman pattern;<a name="FNanchor_1093" id="FNanchor_1093"></a><a href="#Footnote_1093" class="fnanchor">[1093]</a> a good
motte, ditched and banked, with trace of a small bailey
attached. The terrace round the flank of the motte
may be no older than the modern buildings on the
summit.<a name="FNanchor_1094" id="FNanchor_1094"></a><a href="#Footnote_1094" class="fnanchor">[1094]</a> [B. T. S.]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Navan</span>, Meath.&mdash;The <i>Song</i> says Navan was given
to Jocelin de Nangle, and it is known that the castle of
the Nangles was at Navan. A lofty motte, with a very
small semilunar platform below, formed by broadening
out a part of the counterscarp bank of the ditch.
(Compare Kilbixie.) [B. T. S.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nobber</span>, Meath (<i>Cal.</i>, i., 104).&mdash;A castle of Hugh
de Lacy. A motte, with traces of a breastwork round
the top, and wing banks running down to what remains
of the bailey on the S. Two curious little terraces on
the N. side of the motte. No masonry. [B. T. S.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rath&rsquo;</span> (<i>Cal.</i>, i., 95).&mdash;This castle, evidently one of
the most important in Ulster, but hitherto unidentified,
has been shown by Mr Orpen to be the famous castle
of Dundrum, Down.<a name="FNanchor_1095" id="FNanchor_1095"></a><a href="#Footnote_1095" class="fnanchor">[1095]</a> This castle is situated on a
natural motte of rock, no doubt scarped by art, with
a deep ditch cut through the rock, and a bailey
attached. The top of the motte contains a small
ward fortified in stone, and a round keep. It is
very doubtful whether this keep is as old as the time
of John de Courcy, to whom the castle is popularly
attributed; for the round keep without buttresses hardly
appears in England before the reign of Henry III.
[E. S. A.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rathwire</span>, Meath.&mdash;Rathwire was the portion of
Robert de Lacy (<i>Song</i>, 3150), and a castle was built
here by Hugh de Lacy.<a name="FNanchor_1096" id="FNanchor_1096"></a><a href="#Footnote_1096" class="fnanchor">[1096]</a> There is a motte and bailey,
with considerable remains of foundations in the bailey,
and one wing bank going up the motte. [B. T. S.]</p>

<p>*<span class="smcap">Ratouth</span>, Meath, now <span class="smcap">Ratoath</span> (<i>Cal.</i>, i., 110).&mdash;A
castle of Hugh de Lacy. There is &ldquo;a conspicuous
mount&rdquo; near the church, about which there is a legend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
that Malachy, first king of all Ireland, held a convention
of states (Lewis). It is marked in the map.</p>

<p>*<span class="smcap">Rokerel</span> (<i>Cal.</i>, i., 81).&mdash;Unidentified.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roscrea</span>, Tipperary (<i>Cal.</i>, i., 81).&mdash;A motte and
bretasche were built here in King John&rsquo;s reign, as is
recorded in an inquisition of 29 Henry III. (<i>Cal.</i>, i., 412).
There is no motte now at Roscrea, but an Edwardian
castle with mural towers and no keep; a 14th-century
gatehouse tower. Here we have a proved instance of
a motte completely swept away by an Edwardian transformation.<a name="FNanchor_1097" id="FNanchor_1097"></a><a href="#Footnote_1097" class="fnanchor">[1097]</a>
[E. S. A.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Skreen</span>, Meath.&mdash;Giraldus mentions the castle of
Adam de Futepoi, and as Skreen was his barony, his
castle must have been at Skreen. In the grounds of
the modern castellated house at Skreen there is a motte,
11 feet high (probably lowered), with a terrace round its
flank; some slight traces of a bailey. [B. T. S.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Slane</span>, Meath.&mdash;The <i>Song</i> relates the erection of a
motte by Richard the Fleming: &ldquo;un mot fist cil jeter
pur ses enemis grever.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_1098" id="FNanchor_1098"></a><a href="#Footnote_1098" class="fnanchor">[1098]</a> It also tells of its destruction
by the Irish, but does not give its name, which is
supplied by the <i>Annals of Ulster</i>. Probably Richard
the Fleming restored his motte after its destruction, for
there is still a motte on the hill of Slane, with a large
annular bailey,<a name="FNanchor_1099" id="FNanchor_1099"></a><a href="#Footnote_1099" class="fnanchor">[1099]</a> quite large enough for the &ldquo;100
foreigners, besides women and children and horses,&rdquo; who
were in it when it was taken. The motte has still a
slight breastwork round the top. The modern castle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
the Marquis of Conyngham, below, incorporates half a
round tower of 13th-century work, belonging no doubt
to the stone castle which succeeded the motte.<a name="FNanchor_1100" id="FNanchor_1100"></a><a href="#Footnote_1100" class="fnanchor">[1100]</a> [B. T. S.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thurles</span>, Tipperary (Dorles, <i>Cal.</i>, i., 81).&mdash;A castle
of Theobald Walter. Thurles Castle has a late keep
with trefoil windows, and according to Grose was built
by the Earl of Ormond in 1328. From information on the
spot it appears that there used to be a motte in the
gardens behind the castle; mentioned also by Lewis.
[B. T. S.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tibraghny</span>, or <span class="smcap">Tipperaghny</span>, Kilkenny (<i>Gir.</i>, i., 386;
<i>Cal.</i>, i., 19).&mdash;Granted to William de Burgh in 1200;
built by John in 1185.<a name="FNanchor_1101" id="FNanchor_1101"></a><a href="#Footnote_1101" class="fnanchor">[1101]</a> A motte, with ditch and bank,
and some trace of a half-moon bailey to the north.
About 200 yards away is the stone castle, a late keep
with ogee windows. [B. T. S.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Timahoe</span>, Queen&rsquo;s Co. (<i>Gir.</i>, i., 356).&mdash;Built by Hugh
de Lacy for Meiler Fitz Henry. A motte, called the
Rath of Ballynaclogh, half a mile west of the village.
The bailey, the banks and ditches of which seem remarkably
well preserved, is almost circular, but the motte
is placed at its edge, not concentrically. There are
wing-banks running up the motte. Near it are the ruins
of a stone castle built in Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign (Grose).
[B. T. S.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trim</span>, Meath.&mdash;The <i>Song</i> tells of the erection of this
castle by Hugh de Lacy, and how in his absence the
<i>meysun</i> (the keep&mdash;doubtless wooden) was burnt by the
Irish, and the <i>mot</i> levelled with the ground. This
express evidence that the first castle at Trim had a
motte is of great value, because there is no motte there
now. The castle was restored by Raymond le Gros,<a name="FNanchor_1102" id="FNanchor_1102"></a><a href="#Footnote_1102" class="fnanchor">[1102]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
but so quickly that the present remarkable keep can
hardly have been built at that date.<a name="FNanchor_1103" id="FNanchor_1103"></a><a href="#Footnote_1103" class="fnanchor">[1103]</a> [B. T. S.]</p>

<p>*<span class="smcap">Tristerdermot</span> (<i>Gir.</i>, v., 356).&mdash;Castle of Walter
de Riddlesford. Tristerdermot is now Castledermot;
there used to be a <i>rath</i> of some kind here close to the
town. But Mr Orpen inclines to believe that the castle
Giraldus alludes to was at Kilkea, another manor of De
Riddlesford&rsquo;s, where there is a motte, near the modern
castle. &ldquo;In the early English versions of the <i>Expugnatio</i>
Kilcae is put instead of Tristerdermot as the place
where Walter de Riddlesford&rsquo;s castle was built.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_1104" id="FNanchor_1104"></a><a href="#Footnote_1104" class="fnanchor">[1104]</a></p>

<p>*<span class="smcap">Typermesan</span> (<i>Cal.</i>, i., 110).&mdash;Mr Orpen writes that
this name occurs again in a list of churches in the
deanery of Fore, which includes all the parish names in
the half barony of Fore, except Oldcastle and Killeagh.
He suspects that Typermesan is now known as Oldcastle,
&ldquo;where there is a remarkably well-preserved motte and
raised bailey.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_1105" id="FNanchor_1105"></a><a href="#Footnote_1105" class="fnanchor">[1105]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Waterford</span> (<i>Cal.</i>, i., 89).&mdash;We are not told whether
Strongbow built a castle here when he took the town
from the Ostmen in 1170. The castle is not mentioned
till 1215, when it was granted by John to Thomas Fitz-Antony.
Waterford was a walled town in 1170, and
had a tower called Reginald&rsquo;s Tower, which seems to
have been the residence of the two Danish chieftains,
as they were taken prisoners there. Here too, Henry
II. imprisoned Fitz Stephen.<a name="FNanchor_1106" id="FNanchor_1106"></a><a href="#Footnote_1106" class="fnanchor">[1106]</a> It is possible that this
tower, as Mr Orpen supposes,<a name="FNanchor_1107" id="FNanchor_1107"></a><a href="#Footnote_1107" class="fnanchor">[1107]</a> may have been considered
as the castle of Waterford. But the existing &ldquo;Ring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
tower&rdquo; on the line of the walls, which is sometimes
called Reginald&rsquo;s Tower, is certainly a round mural tower
of the 13th century; there are others of similar masonry
on the walls. [B. T. S.]</p>

<p>*<span class="smcap">Wexford</span> (<i>Gir.</i>, v., 314).&mdash;Probably built by Maurice
Prendergast; first mentioned when taken from his sons
in 1176. Mr Orpen writes: &ldquo;The site of Wexford
Castle is an artificial mound. Two of the scarped sides
still remain, and the other two are built up above streets.
When recently laying some drainpipes, the workmen
came upon no rock, but only made earth.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wicklow</span> (<i>Gir.</i>, i., 298).&mdash;Existing when Henry II.
left Ireland in 1173; he gave it to Strongbow. The
Black Castle at Wicklow is a headland castle; it
preserves the motte-and-bailey plan, though there is no
motte, as there is a small triangular inner ward (about
thirty paces each side) several feet higher than the outer
bailey, from which it is separated by a very deep ditch
cut through the rock. [B. T. S.]</p>

<p>We have here a list of seventy-two castles mentioned
in the contemporary history of the Norman invasion.
If the list is reduced by omitting Aq&rsquo;i, Kilmehal, Loske,
Rokerel, and Incheleder, which are not yet identified,
and five castles of which the identification may be considered
doubtful, Caherconlish, Croom, Clahull&rsquo;s Castle,
Lagelachan, and Typermesan, sixty-two castles are left,
and out of these sixty-two, fifty-two have or had mottes.<a name="FNanchor_1108" id="FNanchor_1108"></a><a href="#Footnote_1108" class="fnanchor">[1108]</a>
In five cases the place of the motte is taken by a natural
rock, helped by art; but as the idea and plan are the
same it is legitimately classed as the same type.</p>

<p>This list might easily have been enlarged by the
addition of many castles mentioned in the various Irish
annals as having been built by the Normans. But this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
would have involved the identification of a number of
difficult names, a labour to which the writer&rsquo;s limited
knowledge of Irish topography was not equal. The
greater number of these sites have now been identified
by Mr Orpen, and to his papers, so frequently cited
above, we must refer the reader who wishes to study
the fullest form of the argument sketched in these pages.</p>

<p>One can easily sympathise with the feelings of those
who, having always looked upon these mottes as monuments
of ancient Ireland, are loath to part with them to
the Norman robber. Many of us have had similar
feelings about the mottes of England, some of which we
had been taught to regard as the work of that heroic
pair, Edward the Elder and Ethelfleda. But these
feelings evaporated when we came to realise that it
would have been highly unpatriotic in these founders of
the British empire to have built little castles for their
own personal safety, instead of building cities which
were &ldquo;to shelter all the folk,&rdquo; in the words of Ethelfleda&rsquo;s
charter to Worcester. In like manner, wretched as were
the intertribal wars of Ireland, it would have been a
disgrace to the Irish chieftains if they had consulted
solely their own defence by building these little strongholds
for their personal use.</p>

<p>The Irish motte-castles furnish us with interesting
proof that this type of castle was commonly used, not
only as late as the reign of Henry II., but also in the
reigns of his sons, Richard I. and John;<a name="FNanchor_1109" id="FNanchor_1109"></a><a href="#Footnote_1109" class="fnanchor">[1109]</a> that is to say,
at a time when castle-building in stone was receiving
remarkable developments at the hands of Richard I.
and Philip Augustus of France. This, however, need
not surprise us, since we know that as late as 1242,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
Henry III. was building a motte and wooden castle in
the Isle of Rhé, at the mouth of the Garonne.<a name="FNanchor_1110" id="FNanchor_1110"></a><a href="#Footnote_1110" class="fnanchor">[1110]</a> But
those who imagine that the Normans built stone castles
everywhere in England, Wales, and Ireland, will have
to reconsider their views.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;Mr Orpen&rsquo;s work on <i>Ireland under the
Normans</i> did not appear until too late for use in this
chapter. The reader is referred to it for a more careful
tracing of the history and archæology of the Norman
settlements in Ireland.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a><br />
<span class="smaller">STONE CASTLES OF THE NORMAN PERIOD</span></h2>

<p>It may be a surprise to some of our readers to learn
how very few stone castles there are in England which
can certainly be ascribed to the first period of the
Norman Conquest, that is to the 11th century. When
we have named the Tower of London, Colchester, the
recently excavated foundations of the remarkable keep
at Pevensey, and perhaps the ruined keep of Bramber,
we have completed the list, as far as our present knowledge
goes, though possibly future excavations may add
a few others.<a name="FNanchor_1111" id="FNanchor_1111"></a><a href="#Footnote_1111" class="fnanchor">[1111]</a></p>

<p>It is obvious that so small a number of instances
furnishes a very slender basis for generalisations as to
the characteristics of early Norman keeps, if we ask in
what respect they differed from those of the 12th
century. But it is the object of this chapter to suggest
research, rather than to lay down conclusions. The
four early instances mentioned should be compared with
the earliest keeps of France, the country where the
pattern was developed. This has not yet been done in
any serious way, nor does the present writer pretend to
the knowledge which would be necessary for such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
comparison.<a name="FNanchor_1112" id="FNanchor_1112"></a><a href="#Footnote_1112" class="fnanchor">[1112]</a> But data exist, which, if they were used
in the right way, would greatly add to our knowledge.</p>

<p>In the first place, we have a list of the castles built
by Fulk Nerra, Count of Anjou, at the end of the 10th
and the beginning of the 11th century, during his life-long
struggle with the Counts of Blois for the possession
of Touraine. This list may be regarded as authentic,
as it is given by his grandson, Fulk Rechin, in the
remarkable historical fragment which he has bequeathed
to us.<a name="FNanchor_1113" id="FNanchor_1113"></a><a href="#Footnote_1113" class="fnanchor">[1113]</a> The list is as follows:&mdash;<i>In Touraine</i>: Langeais,
Chaumont-sur-Loire, Montrésor, St Maure. <i>In Poitou</i>:
Mirabeau (N.W. of Poitiers), Montcontour, Faye-la-Vineuse,
Musterolum (Montreuil-Bonnin), Passavent,
Maulevrier. <i>In Anjou</i>: Baugé, Chateau-Gontier,
Durtal. &ldquo;Et multa alia,&rdquo; adds Fulk&rsquo;s grandson. Nine
of these others are mentioned by the chroniclers:
Montbazon, Semblançay, Montboyau, St Florent-le-Vieil,
Chateaufort near Langeais, Chérament, Montrevault,
Montfaucon, and Mateflon. Many of these were
undoubtedly wooden castles, with wooden keeps on
mottes.<a name="FNanchor_1114" id="FNanchor_1114"></a><a href="#Footnote_1114" class="fnanchor">[1114]</a> In many other cases the ancient fabric has
been replaced by a building of the Renaissance period.
Whether any remains of stone donjons built by Fulk
Nerra exist at any of these places except at Langeais,
the writer has been unable to find out; probably
Langeais is the only one; but French archæologists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
are agreed that the ruined tower which stands on the
ridge above the 15th-century castle of Langeais is the
work of this count,<a name="FNanchor_1115" id="FNanchor_1115"></a><a href="#Footnote_1115" class="fnanchor">[1115]</a> a venerable fragment of a 10th-century
keep.<a name="FNanchor_1116" id="FNanchor_1116"></a><a href="#Footnote_1116" class="fnanchor">[1116]</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately only two sides of this tower and the
foundations of the other sides remain. The walls are
only 3 feet 6 inches thick, contrasting strikingly with
the castles of the 12th and 13th centuries, where the
usual thickness is 10 feet, which is often exceeded. This
points to a date before any great improvement had taken
place in assaulting-machinery. The masonry is what
French architects call <i>petit appareil</i>, very small stones,
but regularly coursed. There is no herring-bone work.
The buttresses, of which there are five on the front,
certainly suggest a later date, from the size of the ashlar
with which they are faced, and from their considerable
projection (3 feet on the entrance wall, 2 on the front).
There is no sign of a forebuilding. There are only two
storeys above the basement. The floors have been
supported on ledges, not on vaults. The doorway, a
plain round arch, with bar-holes, is on the first floor;<a name="FNanchor_1117" id="FNanchor_1117"></a><a href="#Footnote_1117" class="fnanchor">[1117]</a>
it is now only a few feet above the ground, but probably
the basement has been partially filled up with rubbish.
The first storey is quite windowless in the walls which
remain. There are no fireplaces nor any loopholes in
these two fragments. In the second storey there are
three rather small windows and one very large one;<a name="FNanchor_1118" id="FNanchor_1118"></a><a href="#Footnote_1118" class="fnanchor">[1118]</a> they
are round arched, have no splay, and their voussoirs are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
of narrow stones alternated with tiles. In these details
they resemble the Early Romanesque, which in England
we call Anglo-Saxon.</p>

<p>The Tower of London and Colchester keep are some
seventy or eighty years later than that of Langeais, and
if we attempt to compare them, we must bear in mind
that Langeais was the work of a noble who was always
in the throes of an acute struggle with a powerful rival,
whereas the Tower and Colchester Castle were built by
a king who had reached a position of power and wealth
beyond that of any neighbouring sovereign.<a name="FNanchor_1119" id="FNanchor_1119"></a><a href="#Footnote_1119" class="fnanchor">[1119]</a> Langeais
is but a small affair compared with these other two
keeps. The larger area,<a name="FNanchor_1120" id="FNanchor_1120"></a><a href="#Footnote_1120" class="fnanchor">[1120]</a> thicker walls, the angle towers
with their provision of stairways, the splayed windows
[of Colchester], the fireplaces, the chapels with round
apses, the mural gallery [of the Tower] cannot be
definitely pronounced to be instances of development
unless we have other instances than Langeais to
compare with them. De Caumont mentions Chateau
du Pin (Calvados), Lithaire (Manche), Beaugency-sur-Loire,
Nogent-le-Rotrou (Eure et Loire), Tour de l&rsquo;Islot
(Seine et Oise), St Suzanne (Mayenne), and Tour de
Broue (Charente Inf.), as instances of keeps of the
11th century.<a name="FNanchor_1121" id="FNanchor_1121"></a><a href="#Footnote_1121" class="fnanchor">[1121]</a> These should be carefully examined by
the student of castle architecture, and De Caumont&rsquo;s
statements as to their date should be verified. Not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
having had the opportunity of doing this, we will only
ask what features the keeps of Langeais, London, and
Colchester have in common, which may serve as marks
of an earlier date than the 12th century.<a name="FNanchor_1122" id="FNanchor_1122"></a><a href="#Footnote_1122" class="fnanchor">[1122]</a> The square
or oblong form and the entrance on the first floor are
common to all three, but also to the keeps of the first
three-quarters of the 12th century. The absence of a
forebuilding is probably an early sign,<a name="FNanchor_1123" id="FNanchor_1123"></a><a href="#Footnote_1123" class="fnanchor">[1123]</a> and so is the
extensive use of tiles.<a name="FNanchor_1124" id="FNanchor_1124"></a><a href="#Footnote_1124" class="fnanchor">[1124]</a> The chapel with a round apse
which projects externally only occurs in the keeps of
London and Colchester, and in the ruins of Pevensey
keep.<a name="FNanchor_1125" id="FNanchor_1125"></a><a href="#Footnote_1125" class="fnanchor">[1125]</a> The absence of a plinth is believed by Enlart to
be an early token.<a name="FNanchor_1126" id="FNanchor_1126"></a><a href="#Footnote_1126" class="fnanchor">[1126]</a> But Colchester has a plinth and so
has the Tower. It is, however, very possible that in
both cases the plinth is a later addition; at Colchester
it is of different stone to the rest of the building, and
may belong to the repairs of Henry II., who was
working on this castle in 1169; while the Tower has
undergone so many alterations in the course of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
eight hundred years of existence that it is difficult to
say whether the rudimentary plinth which it still
possesses is original or not.</p>

<p>Wide-jointed masonry is generally recognised by
architectural students as a mark of the early Norman
style. Even this is a test which may sometimes
deceive; certain kinds of ashlar are very liable to
weather at the edges, and when the wall has been
pointed at a comparatively recent period, a false appearance
of wide joints is produced. Moreover, there are
instances of wide-jointed masonry throughout the
12th century. The use of rubble instead of ashlar is
common at all dates, and depends no doubt on local
conditions, the local provision of stone, or the affluence
or poverty of the castle-builder. We are probably
justified in laying down as a general rule that the
dimensions of the ashlar stones increase as the Middle
Ages advance. There is a gradual transition from the
<i>petit appareil</i> of Fulk Nerra&rsquo;s castle to the large
blocks of well-set stone which were used in the 15th
century.<a name="FNanchor_1127" id="FNanchor_1127"></a><a href="#Footnote_1127" class="fnanchor">[1127]</a> But this law is liable to many exceptions,
and cannot be relied upon as a test of date unless other
signs are present. The Tower of London is built of
Kentish rag; Colchester keep of small cement stones
(septaria), which whether they are re-used Roman stones
or not, resemble very much in size the masonry of
Langeais. It is of course unnecessary to say to anyone
who is in the least acquainted with Norman architecture
that all Norman walls of ashlar are of the core-and-facing
kind, an internal and an external shell of ashlar,
filled up with rubble; a technique which was inherited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
from Roman times in Gaul, but which was not followed
by the Anglo-Saxons.<a name="FNanchor_1128" id="FNanchor_1128"></a><a href="#Footnote_1128" class="fnanchor">[1128]</a></p>

<p>The presence or absence of fireplaces and chimneys
is not a test of date. Colchester is certainly an early
keep,<a name="FNanchor_1129" id="FNanchor_1129"></a><a href="#Footnote_1129" class="fnanchor">[1129]</a> but it is well provided with fireplaces which
appear to be original. These fireplaces have not
proper chimneys, but only holes in the wall a little
above the fireplace. But this rudimentary form of
chimney is found as late as Henry II.&rsquo;s keep at Orford,
and there is said to be documentary mention of a proper
chimney as early as 816 in the monastery of St Gall.<a name="FNanchor_1130" id="FNanchor_1130"></a><a href="#Footnote_1130" class="fnanchor">[1130]</a>
The entire absence of fireplaces is no proof of early
date, for in Henry II.&rsquo;s keep at the Peak in Derbyshire,
the walls of which are almost perfect (except for their
ashlar coats) there are no fireplaces at all, nor are
there any in the 13th-century keep of Pembroke. It is
possible that in these cases a free standing fireplace in
the middle of the room, with a chimney carried up to the
roof, was used. Such a fireplace is described by the poet,
Chrestien of Troyes, but no example is known to exist.<a name="FNanchor_1131" id="FNanchor_1131"></a><a href="#Footnote_1131" class="fnanchor">[1131]</a></p>

<p>But apart from details, if we look at the general plan
of these four early stone castles, we shall see that it is
exactly similar. It is the keep-and-bailey plan, the plan
which prevailed from the 10th to the 13th century, and
was not even superseded by the introduction of the
keepless castle in the latter century.<a name="FNanchor_1132" id="FNanchor_1132"></a><a href="#Footnote_1132" class="fnanchor">[1132]</a> The motte-and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>-bailey
type was of course only another version of the
keep-and-bailey. In this primitive type of castle the
all-important thing was the keep or donjon.<a name="FNanchor_1133" id="FNanchor_1133"></a><a href="#Footnote_1133" class="fnanchor">[1133]</a> Besides
the donjon there was little else but a rampart and ditch.
&ldquo;Until the middle of the 12th century, and in the
simpler examples of the epochs which followed, the
donjon may be said to constitute in itself the whole
castle.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_1134" id="FNanchor_1134"></a><a href="#Footnote_1134" class="fnanchor">[1134]</a> Piper states that up to the time of the
Crusades German castles do not seem to have been
furnished with mural towers.<a name="FNanchor_1135" id="FNanchor_1135"></a><a href="#Footnote_1135" class="fnanchor">[1135]</a> Köhler, whose work
treats of French and English castles as well as
German, says that mural towers did not become
general till the second half of the 12th century.<a name="FNanchor_1136" id="FNanchor_1136"></a><a href="#Footnote_1136" class="fnanchor">[1136]</a>
Nevertheless, as it is highly probable that the
baileys of castles were defended at first with only
wooden ramparts on earthen banks, even when the
donjon was of stone, it is not unlikely that mural
towers of wood may have existed at an earlier
period than these writers suppose. It is, however,
in favour of the general absence of mural towers
that the word <i>turris</i>, even in 12th-century records,
invariably means the <i>keep</i>, as though no other towers
existed.<a name="FNanchor_1137" id="FNanchor_1137"></a><a href="#Footnote_1137" class="fnanchor">[1137]</a></p>

<p>That the baileys of some of the most important
castles in England had only these wooden and earthen
defences, even as late as the 13th century, can be amply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
proved from the <i>Close Rolls</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1138" id="FNanchor_1138"></a><a href="#Footnote_1138" class="fnanchor">[1138]</a> Colchester Castle had
only a timber wall on the banks of its bailey as late as
1215, and in 1219 this <i>palicium</i> was blown down and an
order issued for its reconstruction.<a name="FNanchor_1139" id="FNanchor_1139"></a><a href="#Footnote_1139" class="fnanchor">[1139]</a></p>

<p>The arrangements in the stone donjons were probably
the same as those we have already described when
writing of the wooden ones.<a name="FNanchor_1140" id="FNanchor_1140"></a><a href="#Footnote_1140" class="fnanchor">[1140]</a> The basement was
the storehouse for provisions,<a name="FNanchor_1141" id="FNanchor_1141"></a><a href="#Footnote_1141" class="fnanchor">[1141]</a> the first floor was
generally the guardhouse, the second the habitation,
of the lord and lady. Where there were three or four
storeys, the arrangements varied, and the finest rooms
are often found on the third floor. An oratory was
probably an invariable feature, though it cannot always
be detected in ruined keeps. One of Mr Clark&rsquo;s most
pronounced mistakes was his idea that these keeps were
merely towers of refuge used only in time of war.<a name="FNanchor_1142" id="FNanchor_1142"></a><a href="#Footnote_1142" class="fnanchor">[1142]</a>
History abounds with evidence that they were the
permanent residences of the nobles of the 11th and
12th centuries. The cooking, as a rule, was carried on
in a separate building, of which there are remains in
some places.<a name="FNanchor_1143" id="FNanchor_1143"></a><a href="#Footnote_1143" class="fnanchor">[1143]</a></p>

<p>Occasionally we find a variant of the keep-and-bailey
type, which we may call the gatehouse keep. The most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
remarkable instance of this kind in England is Exeter,
which appears never to have had any keep but the
primitive gatehouse, undoubtedly the work of Baldwin
de Moeles, the first builder of the castle. In Normandy,
De Caumont gives several instances of gatehouse
keeps. Plessis-Grimoult (which has been visited
by the writer) has a fragment of a gatehouse tower,
but has also a mural tower on the line of the walls;
as the castle was ruined and abandoned in 1047, these
remains must be of early date.<a name="FNanchor_1144" id="FNanchor_1144"></a><a href="#Footnote_1144" class="fnanchor">[1144]</a> The gatehouse
keep is probably an economical device for combining
a citadel with the defence of the weakest part of the
castle.</p>

<p>We must pass on to the keeps of Henry I.<a name="FNanchor_1145" id="FNanchor_1145"></a><a href="#Footnote_1145" class="fnanchor">[1145]</a> There
is only one in England which authentic history gives to
his time, that of Rochester.<a name="FNanchor_1146" id="FNanchor_1146"></a><a href="#Footnote_1146" class="fnanchor">[1146]</a> But the chronicler Robert
de Torigny<a name="FNanchor_1147" id="FNanchor_1147"></a><a href="#Footnote_1147" class="fnanchor">[1147]</a> has fortunately given us a list of the keeps
and castles built by Henry in Normandy, and though
many of these are now destroyed, and others in ruins, a
certain number are left, which, taken along with
Rochester, may give us an idea of the type of keep
built in Henry I.&rsquo;s time. The keeps attributed by
Robert to Henry I. are Arques, Gisors, Falaise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
Argentan, Exmes, Domfront, Ambrières, Vire, Waure,
Vernon, Evreux, Alençon, St Jean, and Coutances.
How many of these survive we cannot positively say;<a name="FNanchor_1148" id="FNanchor_1148"></a><a href="#Footnote_1148" class="fnanchor">[1148]</a>
we can only speak of those we have seen (Falaise,
Domfront, and Gisors),<a name="FNanchor_1149" id="FNanchor_1149"></a><a href="#Footnote_1149" class="fnanchor">[1149]</a> and of Arques, described by
M. Deville in his <i>Histoire du Chateau d&rsquo;Arques</i>, by
M. Viollet le Duc in his treatise on Donjons,<a name="FNanchor_1150" id="FNanchor_1150"></a><a href="#Footnote_1150" class="fnanchor">[1150]</a> and by
Mr G. T. Clark.<a name="FNanchor_1151" id="FNanchor_1151"></a><a href="#Footnote_1151" class="fnanchor">[1151]</a></p>

<p>Speaking under correction, as a prolonged study of
the keeps in Normandy was impossible to the writer, we
should say that there is no very striking difference to be
observed between the keeps of Henry I. and those built
by his father. The development of the forebuilding
seems to be the most important change, if indeed we
are justified in assuming that the 11th-century keeps
never had it; its remains can be seen at Arques,
Falaise,<a name="FNanchor_1152" id="FNanchor_1152"></a><a href="#Footnote_1152" class="fnanchor">[1152]</a> Domfront, and Rochester. At Arques and
Falaise the doorway is on the second floor, which is an
innovation, a new attempt to solve the difficulty of
defending the entrance. The first floor at Arques could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
only be entered by a trap from the second floor; at
Falaise there is a stone stair from one to the other.
Rochester is entered from the first floor. The basement
storeys of Arques, Falaise, and Domfront are quite
unlit; at the Tower the basement has had a number
of loopholes, and the angular heads of those which
remain suggest that they are at least copied from
original lights. The main floors in Henry I.&rsquo;s
keeps are always of wood, but this was not because
vaulting was then unknown, because the crypt, sub-crypt,
and chapel of the Tower are vaulted, not to
speak of many early churches.<a name="FNanchor_1153" id="FNanchor_1153"></a><a href="#Footnote_1153" class="fnanchor">[1153]</a> The four keeps
mentioned have all three storeys, thus not exceeding
Colchester in height;<a name="FNanchor_1154" id="FNanchor_1154"></a><a href="#Footnote_1154" class="fnanchor">[1154]</a> the Tower has now four
storeys, but a good authority has remarked that the
fourth storey has not improbably been made by dividing
the third.</p>

<p>No marked advance is observable in the masonry
of these keeps. Arques is built of <i>petit appareil</i>;
Falaise of small stones in herring-bone work; Domfront
of very small stones rudely coursed; Rochester of Kentish
rag mixed with flint rubble. Both Falaise and Domfront
have plinths of superior masonry, but there is
always the possibility that these plinths are later
additions. The voussoirs of the arches at Falaise,
Domfront, and Rochester are larger than the rag or
tile voussoirs which are used at Colchester, the Tower,
and Langeais. At Rochester and Arques provision is
made for carrying the water-supply from the well in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
basement to the upper floors, a provision of which there
is no trace in the older keeps.<a name="FNanchor_1155" id="FNanchor_1155"></a><a href="#Footnote_1155" class="fnanchor">[1155]</a></p>

<p>As Robert de Monte says that Henry I. built many
castles in England as well as in Normandy, we naturally
ask what other English keeps besides Rochester may
be assigned to him. It appears to the writer that
Corfe and Norwich keeps may very likely be his.
Both were royal castles in his time, and both were
originally wooden castles on mottes.<a name="FNanchor_1156" id="FNanchor_1156"></a><a href="#Footnote_1156" class="fnanchor">[1156]</a> Both these
castles have forebuildings, and neither of them have
floors supported on vaults.<a name="FNanchor_1157" id="FNanchor_1157"></a><a href="#Footnote_1157" class="fnanchor">[1157]</a> Corfe has very superior
masonry, of larger stones than those used in the keeps
known to be Henry I.&rsquo;s, but wide-jointed. At Norwich
only a very small piece of the original ashlar is left.
Corfe is extremely severe in all its details, but quite
corresponds to work of Henry I.&rsquo;s reign.<a name="FNanchor_1158" id="FNanchor_1158"></a><a href="#Footnote_1158" class="fnanchor">[1158]</a> Norwich
has a great deal of decoration, more advanced in
style than that to be seen at Falaise, but still consistent
with the first half of the 12th century.
Neither keep has the least sign of Transition
Norman, such as we seldom fail to find in the keeps
of Henry II. Moreover, neither of them figure in
the <i>Pipe Rolls</i> of Henry II., except for repairs;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
and as Stephen in his harassed reign can hardly
have had any money for building stone keeps, we
may with some confidence ascribe these two keeps to
Henry I.</p>

<p>A few words should be given to the castle of Gisors,
which contains in itself an epitome of castle history.
The first castle, built by William Rufus in 1096, was
undoubtedly a wooden castle on a motte, with a
stockaded bailey below it; certain portions of the
present bailey walls rest on earthen banks, which
probably belonged to the original castle, and show what
a much smaller affair it was than the present one.
Henry I., Robert de Monte tells us, strengthened this
castle with a keep. Probably this was the shell wall
which now crowns the motte; the smallness of the
masonry (stones about 5 inches high, rudely dressed
and coursed) and the slight projection of the buttresses
(9 inches) agree with much of the work of his time.
There would be a wooden tower inside.<a name="FNanchor_1159" id="FNanchor_1159"></a><a href="#Footnote_1159" class="fnanchor">[1159]</a> The chemise
or shell wall is pierced by loopholes, a very unusual
arrangement; they are round arched, and of very rude
voussoirs.<a name="FNanchor_1160" id="FNanchor_1160"></a><a href="#Footnote_1160" class="fnanchor">[1160]</a> Inside this shell there is a decagonal
tower, called the Tower of Thomas à Becket, which
is almost certainly the work of Henry II.,<a name="FNanchor_1161" id="FNanchor_1161"></a><a href="#Footnote_1161" class="fnanchor">[1161]</a> as
its name would indicate; the chapel of St Thomas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
is close to it. A stair turret of the 15th century
has been added to this keep; its original entrance
was, as usual, a door on the first floor, but a basement
entrance was built afterwards, probably in the
13th century. Philip Augustus, after he had taken
this castle from John, added to it one of the round
keeps which had then become the fashion, and subsequent
enlargements of the bailey converted it into
a &ldquo;concentric&rdquo; castle, of which the motte now forms the
centre.</p>

<p>There is one keep which is known to be of the
reign of Stephen, though not built by him, that of
Carlisle, built by David, King of Scotland, in 1136,<a name="FNanchor_1162" id="FNanchor_1162"></a><a href="#Footnote_1162" class="fnanchor">[1162]</a>
a time when he thought his hold on the four northern
counties of England was secure, little reckoning on
the true character of his great-nephew, Henry, son
of Matilda. There is no advance to be seen in this
keep on those of Henry I., except that the walls
are faced with ashlar. The vaulting of the basement
is pronounced by Mr Clark to be very evidently a late
insertion.<a name="FNanchor_1163" id="FNanchor_1163"></a><a href="#Footnote_1163" class="fnanchor">[1163]</a></p>

<p>With the reign of Henry II. a new era opens as
regards the documentary history of our ancient castles,
because the <i>Pipe Rolls</i> of that king&rsquo;s reign have most
fortunately been preserved.<a name="FNanchor_1164" id="FNanchor_1164"></a><a href="#Footnote_1164" class="fnanchor">[1164]</a> These contain the sheriff&rsquo;s
accounts for money spent on the building or repair of
the king&rsquo;s castles, and are simply invaluable for the
history of castle architecture. The following is a list of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
the keeps which the <i>Pipe Rolls</i> show to have been built
or finished by Henry II.:&mdash;</p>

<p>The dates given here must be taken as only roughly
accurate, as owing to the meagreness of the entries in
the <i>Pipe Rolls</i>, it is not always certain whether the
expenses were for the great tower or for other buildings.
The list by no means includes all the work which Henry
II. did on his English castles, for he was a great builder;
but a good deal of his work seems to have been the
substitution of stone walls with mural towers, for wooden
stockades, and our list comprises all the cases in which
it is clear that the keep was the work of this king.<a name="FNanchor_1165" id="FNanchor_1165"></a><a href="#Footnote_1165" class="fnanchor">[1165]</a> We
confine our attention to the keeps, because though mural
towers of stone began to be added to the walls of baileys
during Henry II.&rsquo;s reign (a detail which must have
greatly altered the general appearance of castles), it is
certain that the keep was still the most important part,
and the residence of the king or noble whenever he
visited the castle.</p>

<p>Seven out of the ten tower keeps are built on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
precisely the same plan as those of Henry I. The chief
advance is in the masonry. All the tower keeps of
Henry II., except Dover, Chilham, and Canterbury, are
or have been cased with good ashlar, of stones somewhat
larger in size than those used by Henry I. The same
may be said of the shell walls (namely, Windsor and
Arundel); it is interesting to note that Henry II. still
used this elementary form of citadel, which consisted
merely of a wall round the top of a motte, with wooden
buildings inside.<a name="FNanchor_1166" id="FNanchor_1166"></a><a href="#Footnote_1166" class="fnanchor">[1166]</a> In three cases out of the ten tower
keeps, Newcastle, Bowes, and Richmond, the basement
storey is vaulted, which does not occur in the older
keeps.<a name="FNanchor_1167" id="FNanchor_1167"></a><a href="#Footnote_1167" class="fnanchor">[1167]</a> Yet such important castles as Scarborough,
Dover, and Canterbury are without this provision
against fire. None of these keeps appear to have more
than three storeys above the basement.<a name="FNanchor_1168" id="FNanchor_1168"></a><a href="#Footnote_1168" class="fnanchor">[1168]</a> None of the
entrances to the keeps (except Tickhill) have any portcullis
grooves,<a name="FNanchor_1169" id="FNanchor_1169"></a><a href="#Footnote_1169" class="fnanchor">[1169]</a> nor any special contrivances for defence,
except at Canterbury, where the entrance (on the first
floor) takes two turns at right angles before reaching
the hall to which it leads.<a name="FNanchor_1170" id="FNanchor_1170"></a><a href="#Footnote_1170" class="fnanchor">[1170]</a> There are nearly always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
in the keeps of Henry II. some signs of Transition
Norman in the details, such as the nook shafts at the
angles of the towers of Scarborough and the Peak,
certain arches at Canterbury, the Transition capitals
used at Newcastle, and the filleted string round the
outside of Bowes.</p>

<p>But we have yet to speak of three keeps of Henry II.&rsquo;s
reign which are on a different plan to all the others,
and which point to coming changes&mdash;Chilham, Orford,
and Tickhill.<a name="FNanchor_1171" id="FNanchor_1171"></a><a href="#Footnote_1171" class="fnanchor">[1171]</a> Chilham is an octagonal tower of three
storeys, with a square annexe on one side, which appears
to be original. Orford is polygonal outside, round inside.
Orford indeed is one of the most extraordinary keeps to
be seen anywhere, and we must regard it as an experiment,
and an experiment which appears never to have
been repeated.<a name="FNanchor_1172" id="FNanchor_1172"></a><a href="#Footnote_1172" class="fnanchor">[1172]</a> Instead of the usual Norman buttresses,
this polygonal keep has three buttress towers, placed
between every four of the outer faces, 22 feet wide, and
12 feet in projection.<a name="FNanchor_1173" id="FNanchor_1173"></a><a href="#Footnote_1173" class="fnanchor">[1173]</a> Tickhill, however, the last keep
he built, is decagonal. The object of the polygonal
tower was to deflect the missiles thrown from siege
engines, and the round tower was evidently considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
an improvement on the polygonal for this purpose, as
it subsequently supplanted the polygonal type. It is
therefore rather remarkable that Henry II. built both
these keeps in the second decade of his reign, and
afterwards went on building square keeps like his predecessors.
We have seen, however, that he built at
least one polygonal tower in Normandy, that of
Gisors. We must bear in mind that the Norman
and Angevine frontier was the theatre of the continuous
struggle of Henry II. with the French kings,
Louis VII. and Philip Augustus, and that it is here that
we must expect the greatest developments in military
architecture.</p>

<p>Speaking generally, we may say that just as there
was comparatively little change in armour during the
12th century until the end of Henry II.&rsquo;s reign, so there
was comparatively little change in military architecture
during the same period. But great changes took place
towards the end of the 12th century. One of these
changes was a great improvement in missile engines;
the trébuchet was one of the most important of these.
It could throw much heavier stones than the largest
catapult, and could take a more accurate aim.<a name="FNanchor_1174" id="FNanchor_1174"></a><a href="#Footnote_1174" class="fnanchor">[1174]</a> These
new engines were useful for defence as well as attack,
and this affected the architecture of castles, because flat
roofs covered with lead, on which machines could be
placed, were now substituted for the former sloping
roofs.<a name="FNanchor_1175" id="FNanchor_1175"></a><a href="#Footnote_1175" class="fnanchor">[1175]</a> There are several payments for lead for roofing
castles in the <i>Pipe Rolls</i> of Henry II., the earliest
being in 1166. In the reigns of John and Henry III.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
the mention of lead for roofing becomes much more
frequent.<a name="FNanchor_1176" id="FNanchor_1176"></a><a href="#Footnote_1176" class="fnanchor">[1176]</a></p>

<p>Hitherto, in the defence of keeps, reliance had mainly
been placed upon their passive strength, though not so
entirely as has been commonly assumed, since it was
always the practice to shoot with arrows from the
battlements round the roof of the tower. But not only
was the fighting strength of the keep increased by the
trébuchet, but the introduction of the crossbow gave
it a defensive arm of the greatest importance. The
crossbow had been known to the Romans, and was used
in the early part of the 12th century, but it was forbidden
by the second Lateran Council in 1139 as a weapon
hateful to God.<a name="FNanchor_1177" id="FNanchor_1177"></a><a href="#Footnote_1177" class="fnanchor">[1177]</a> This prohibition seems actually to
have been effective, as William the Breton says expressly
that the crossbow was unknown to the French before
the wars of Richard I. and Philip Augustus.<a name="FNanchor_1178" id="FNanchor_1178"></a><a href="#Footnote_1178" class="fnanchor">[1178]</a> Richard
learned the use of it in the third crusade.<a name="FNanchor_1179" id="FNanchor_1179"></a><a href="#Footnote_1179" class="fnanchor">[1179]</a> But to use
the crossbow in the defence of buildings it was necessary
to construct special loopholes for shooting, splayed
downwards externally, so that it was possible to aim
from them. Up till this time the loopholes of castles
had been purely for light and not for shooting; anyone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
may see that it is impossible to take aim through an
immensely thick wall unless there is a downward splay
to increase the field of vision. William the Breton tells
us that Richard built windows for crossbows to his
towers, and this is the first mention we have of them.<a name="FNanchor_1180" id="FNanchor_1180"></a><a href="#Footnote_1180" class="fnanchor">[1180]</a></p>

<p>From this time defensive loopholes become common
in castles, and take various fanciful forms, as well as the
commoner ones of the circle, square, or triangle at the
base of the loop. The <i>cross loophole</i>, which does not
appear till the latter quarter of the 13th century, is
explained by Viollet le Duc as an ingenious way of
allowing three or four archers to fire in a volley.<a name="FNanchor_1181" id="FNanchor_1181"></a><a href="#Footnote_1181" class="fnanchor">[1181]</a> But
up to the present time very little study has been given to
this subject, and we must be content to leave the question
for future observation to settle.<a name="FNanchor_1182" id="FNanchor_1182"></a><a href="#Footnote_1182" class="fnanchor">[1182]</a></p>

<p>The crossbowmen not only required splayed loopholes,
but also niches, large enough to accommodate at
least three men, so that a continuous discharge of darts
(quarrells) might be kept up. Any defensive loop which
really means work will have a niche like this behind it.
These niches had the defect of seriously weakening the
wall.</p>

<p>Another innovation introduced by Richard I. was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
that of stone machicolations, or <i>hurdicia</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1183" id="FNanchor_1183"></a><a href="#Footnote_1183" class="fnanchor">[1183]</a> Whether
wooden galleries round the tops of walls, with holes for
dropping down stones, boiling-water, or pitch on the
heads of the besiegers had not been used from the
earliest times, is regarded by Köhler as extremely doubtful.<a name="FNanchor_1184" id="FNanchor_1184"></a><a href="#Footnote_1184" class="fnanchor">[1184]</a>
They were certainly used by the Romans, and
may even be seen clearly figured on the Assyrian
monuments. In the Bayeux Tapestry, the picture of
Bayeux Castle shows the stockade on top of the motte
crested with something extremely like hurdicia. Yet
the writer has found no authentic mention of them
before the end of the 12th century.<a name="FNanchor_1185" id="FNanchor_1185"></a><a href="#Footnote_1185" class="fnanchor">[1185]</a> The stone machicolations
built by Richard round his keep of Chateau
Gaillard are of an unusual type, which was only rarely
imitated.<a name="FNanchor_1186" id="FNanchor_1186"></a><a href="#Footnote_1186" class="fnanchor">[1186]</a> But from this time wooden hurdicia became
universal, to judge from the numerous orders for timber
for <i>hoarding</i> castles and town walls in the <i>Close Rolls</i>
of the first half of the 13th century. Towards the
middle of the 13th century stone brackets for the support
of wooden hurdicia began to be used; they may still
be seen in the great keep of Coucy, which was begun
in 1230. But machicolations entirely of stone, supported
on double or triple rows of brackets, do not become
common till the 14th century.<a name="FNanchor_1187" id="FNanchor_1187"></a><a href="#Footnote_1187" class="fnanchor">[1187]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span></p>

<p>The greatest architectural change witnessed at the
end of the 12th century was the victory of the round
keep over the square. Round towers were built by the
Romans as mural towers, but the universal type of
mediæval keep appears to have been the square or
oblong, until towards the end of the 12th century.<a name="FNanchor_1188" id="FNanchor_1188"></a><a href="#Footnote_1188" class="fnanchor">[1188]</a>
The polygonal keep was probably a transitional form;
we have seen that Henry II.&rsquo;s polygonal keep at Orford
was begun as early as 1165. Many experiments seem
to have been made at the end of the 12th century, such
as the addition of a stone prow to the weakest side of a
keep, to enable it better to resist showers of missiles.
Richard I.&rsquo;s keep at Chateau Gaillard is a round keep
with a solid prow of this kind. Five-sided keeps are
said to be not uncommon on the left bank of the Rhine
and in Nassau; this type was simply the addition of a
prow to a square keep. The only English instance
known to the writer is that of Mitford, Northumberland,
but this is merely a five-sided keep, the prow is not solid,
as at Chateau Gaillard. The castle of Étampes, whose
plan is a quatrefoil, is assigned by French archæologists
to this period of experiment.<a name="FNanchor_1189" id="FNanchor_1189"></a><a href="#Footnote_1189" class="fnanchor">[1189]</a> But the round keep was
eventually the type preferred. Philip II. thought it
necessary to add a round keep to the castle of Gisors,
after he had taken it from John, and he adopted the
round keep for all his new castles, of which the Louvre
was one.<a name="FNanchor_1190" id="FNanchor_1190"></a><a href="#Footnote_1190" class="fnanchor">[1190]</a></p>

<p>Along with the round keep, ground entrances became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
common.<a name="FNanchor_1191" id="FNanchor_1191"></a><a href="#Footnote_1191" class="fnanchor">[1191]</a> Viollet le Duc states that when the French
soldiers broke into the inner ward at Chateau Gaillard
the defenders had no time to escape into the keep by the
narrow stair which led to the first floor, and consequently
this proud tower was surrendered without a blow; and
that this event so impressed on Philip&rsquo;s mind the danger
of difficult entrances that he abandoned the old fashion.
This may be true, but it is a pure guess of Le Duc&rsquo;s, as
there is nothing whatever to justify it in William the
Breton&rsquo;s circumstantial narrative. It is, however,
certain that Philip adopted the ground entrance to all
his keeps. In England we find ground entrances to
many round keeps of the 13th century, as at Pembroke;
but the older fashion was sometimes retained; Conisburgh,
one of the finest keeps in England, has its
entrance on the first floor.<a name="FNanchor_1192" id="FNanchor_1192"></a><a href="#Footnote_1192" class="fnanchor">[1192]</a></p>

<p>After the introduction of the trébuchet, we might
expect that the walls of keeps would be made very much
thicker, and such seems to have been the case in France,<a name="FNanchor_1193" id="FNanchor_1193"></a><a href="#Footnote_1193" class="fnanchor">[1193]</a>
but we do not find that it was the rule in England.<a name="FNanchor_1194" id="FNanchor_1194"></a><a href="#Footnote_1194" class="fnanchor">[1194]</a>
The lower storeys were now generally instead of occasionally
vaulted. In the course of the 13th century it
became common to vault all the storeys. But in spite
of the military advantages of the round keep, in its
avoidance of angles favourable to the battering-ram, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
its deflection of missiles, the square keep continued to be
built in various parts of both France and England till
quite late in the Middle Ages.<a name="FNanchor_1195" id="FNanchor_1195"></a><a href="#Footnote_1195" class="fnanchor">[1195]</a> On the Scottish border,
square towers of the ancient type, with quite Norman
decorations, were built as late as the 15th century.<a name="FNanchor_1196" id="FNanchor_1196"></a><a href="#Footnote_1196" class="fnanchor">[1196]</a>
The advantage of the square tower was that it was
more roomy inside, and was therefore preferred when
the tower was intended for habitation.</p>

<p>We come now to the greatest of all the changes introduced
in the 13th century: the keepless castle, in which
the keep is done away with altogether, and the castle
consists of a square or oblong court surrounded by a
strong wall with massive towers at the angles, and in
large castles, in the curtain also.<a name="FNanchor_1197" id="FNanchor_1197"></a><a href="#Footnote_1197" class="fnanchor">[1197]</a> Usually this inner
quadrangle is encircled with an outer quadrangle of
walls and towers, so that this type of castle is frequently
called the <i>concentric</i>. But the castles of the keepless
kind are not invariably concentric; those built by
Edward I. at Conway, Carnarvon, and Flint are not
so.<a name="FNanchor_1198" id="FNanchor_1198"></a><a href="#Footnote_1198" class="fnanchor">[1198]</a> Instead of a dark and comfortless keep, the royal
or noble owner is provided in this type of castle with a
palatial house. In England this house is frequently
attached to the gateway, forming what we may call
a gatehouse palace; good examples may be seen
at Beaumaris, Harlech, and Tonbridge.<a name="FNanchor_1199" id="FNanchor_1199"></a><a href="#Footnote_1199" class="fnanchor">[1199]</a> The gate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>way
itself is always defended by a pair of massive
towers.</p>

<p>Edward I. is generally credited with the introduction
of this type of castle into England, but until the <i>Pipe
Rolls</i> of Henry III.&rsquo;s reign have been carefully examined,
we cannot be certain that it was not introduced earlier.
It was certainly known in Germany fifty years before
Edward&rsquo;s accession to the throne, and in France as early
as 1231.<a name="FNanchor_1200" id="FNanchor_1200"></a><a href="#Footnote_1200" class="fnanchor">[1200]</a></p>

<p>It is always supposed that this type of castle was
introduced by the Crusaders from Syria. But when did
it make its first appearance in Syria? This is a point
which, we venture to think, has not been yet sufficiently
investigated. We do not believe that it can have
existed in Syria at the time of the third crusade,
otherwise Richard I., who is universally acknowledged
to have been a first-class military architect, would have
brought the idea home with him.<a name="FNanchor_1201" id="FNanchor_1201"></a><a href="#Footnote_1201" class="fnanchor">[1201]</a> Yet his favourite
castle of Chateau Gaillard, built in accordance with the
latest military science, is in the main a castle of the
keep-and-bailey type, and has even a reminiscence of
the motte, in the scarped rock on which the keep and
inner ward are placed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span></p>

<p>The new type of keepless castle never entirely displaced
the old keep-and-bailey type. We have already
seen that keeps of the old sort continued to be built till
the end of the Middle Ages. Hawarden Castle has a
good example of a 14th-century round keep; Warkworth
a most remarkable specimen of the 15th, the
plan being a square tower with polygonal turrets set on
each face.<a name="FNanchor_1202" id="FNanchor_1202"></a><a href="#Footnote_1202" class="fnanchor">[1202]</a> In France and Germany also the old type
appears to have persisted.<a name="FNanchor_1203" id="FNanchor_1203"></a><a href="#Footnote_1203" class="fnanchor">[1203]</a></p>

<p>We have already trespassed beyond the limits of our
subject; but as we offer this chapter more as a
programme of work than as a categorical outline, we
trust it may not be without use to the student who may
feel disposed to take up this much-neglected subject.</p>

<p>A few words must yet be said about the state of the
law relating to castles. Nothing explicit has come
down to us on this subject from the 11th century in
England, but it is clear that the feudal system which
William introduced, and which required that all lands
should revert to the king on the death of the holder,
forbade the building of any castle without the king&rsquo;s
license, and, further, allowed only a life tenure in each
case. The Council of Lillebonne in 1080 had laid it
down in express terms that no one should build a
castle in Normandy without the permission of the duke;<a name="FNanchor_1204" id="FNanchor_1204"></a><a href="#Footnote_1204" class="fnanchor">[1204]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
and William, after his great victory over his revolted
barons, had enforced the right of garrisoning their
castles. He was not able to do this in England,
while he must have desired to check the building of
private castles as far as possible. On the other hand,
he had to face the dilemma that no Norman land-holder
would be safe in his usurped estates without the shelter
of a castle. In this situation we have the elements of
the civil strife which burst forth in Stephen&rsquo;s reign, and
which was ended by what we may call the anti-castle
policy of Henry II.<a name="FNanchor_1205" id="FNanchor_1205"></a><a href="#Footnote_1205" class="fnanchor">[1205]</a></p>

<p>The rights secured by this able king were often
recklessly sold by his successors, but in the reign of
Henry III. it was evidently illegal even to fortify an
ordinary house with a ditch and stockade without royal
permission.<a name="FNanchor_1206" id="FNanchor_1206"></a><a href="#Footnote_1206" class="fnanchor">[1206]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Feudalism was an inevitable phase in the evolution
of the Western nations, and it ought neither to be
idealised nor execrated. After the break-up of the
tribal system the nations of Europe sought refuge in
the forms of imperialism which were devised by
Charlemagne, and even the small and distant island of
England strove to move in the same direction. But
the times were not ripe for centralisation on so great a
scale, and when the system of the Carlovingian Empire
gave way under the inrush of Northmen and Huns,
European society would have fallen into ruin had it not
been for the institutions of feudalism. These offered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
in place of the old blood bond of the tribe, a social
compact which, though itself artificial, was so admirably
adapted to the general need that it was speedily adopted
by all the progressive nations of Europe. The great
merit of feudalism was that it replaced the collective
responsibility of the tribe by the individual responsibility
of the man to his lord, and of the lord to his man. In
an age when the decay of mutual trust was the worst
evil of society it laid stress on individual loyalty, and
insisted that personal honour should consist in the fulfilment
of obligations. Being a system so wholly personal,
its usefulness depended largely on the nature of the person
in power, and it was therefore liable to great abuses.</p>

<p>But it is probable that feudalism worked better on
the whole in England than in any other part of Western
Europe. The worst evils of French feudalism never
appeared in this country, except during the short and
disastrous reign of Stephen. The strong kings of the
Norman and Plantagenet Houses held in check the
turbulence of the barons; and private war was never
allowed to become here, as it was on the Continent, a
standing evil. To follow out this subject would lead us
beyond the limits of this book, but it is interesting to
remember that not only the picturesque ruins of our
castles, but also the neglected green hillocks of which
we have treated in this work, while they point to the
skilful machinery by which the Norman Conquest was
riveted on the land, bear witness also to something still
more important. They tell of a period of discipline and
education through which the English people passed,
when in spite of much oppression and sometimes even
cruelty, seeds of many noble and useful things were
sown, from which succeeding generations have garnered
the enduring fruit.</p>

<p>The popular meetings of the Anglo-Saxons, those of the
hundred and the shire, were held in the open air. Since many
of those who attended them had to travel far, some sign was
necessary to mark out the place of meeting, and some striking
feature, such as a hillock, or a particular tree, or an ancient
barrow, was chosen. Thus we have the Shire Oak, near Leeds,
which gives its name to the wapentake of Skyrack; and in a
charter of Edgar we find the <i>mot-beorh</i> mentioned, and translated
<i>Congressionis Collem</i> = the meeting barrow. (<i>M. A.</i>, ii.,
324.) It does not appear that a hillock was an essential feature
of these meeting-places, though this is popularly supposed to be
the case, because the &ldquo;Thing-wall&rdquo; in Iceland and the &ldquo;Tynwald&rdquo;
in the Isle of Man have hillocks from which laws were
proclaimed. The Thingwall, or field of meeting in Iceland had
a natural rock just above it, isolated by a stream, and though
proclamations were made from this rock, deliberations took
place on the level. (Gomme&rsquo;s <i>Primitive Folk-Moots</i>, 31.)</p>

<p>The Tynwald Hill, in the Isle of Man, which is also still used
for the proclamation of new laws, was probably an ancient
barrow, as there are other barrows in the immediate neighbourhood.
(Kermode and Herdman, <i>Illustrated Notes on Manx
Antiquities</i>, pp. 23 and 61.) At Thingwall, near Liverpool, and
Thingwall in Wirral, both probably Norse settlements, there is
no hillock.</p>

<p>In Scotland, the use of a former motte as a meeting-place
for the baronial court appears to have been much more common
than in England. Mr George Neilson&rsquo;s explanation of this fact
is referred to in Chapter X., <a href="#Page_307">p. 307</a>.</p>

<span class="smaller">WATLING STREET AND THE DANELAGH</span></h2>

<p>It has been pointed out by Schmid (<i>Gesetze der Angelsachsen</i>,

Peace</i> cannot belong to the year of Guthrum&rsquo;s baptism at
Wedmore; and Mr J. R. Green (<i>Conquest of England</i>, p. 151)
goes further, and doubts whether the boundaries laid down in
this deed refer to anything except to the East Anglian kingdom
of Guthrum. But Mr Green gives no adequate reason for
rejecting the generally accepted conclusion that the Watling
Street was the boundary between English and Danish Mercia,
which is borne out by the following facts: (1) the Danish
confederacy of the five boroughs, Lincoln, Stamford, Leicester,
Nottingham, and Derby, pretty well covers the part of Mercia
north of Watling Street, especially when Chester is added, as it
sometimes is, to the list; (2) the division into wapentakes
instead of hundreds, now believed to be of Danish origin, is
found in Lincolnshire, Notts, Derbyshire, Rutland, Leicestershire,
and Northamptonshire. Staffordshire, it is true, is not
divided into wapentakes, but it was apparently won by
conquest when Ethelfleda fortified the town. Chester was
occupied by her husband in 908. Watling Street furnishes such
a well-defined line that it was natural to fix upon it as a frontier.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE MILITARY ORIGIN OF ALFRED&rsquo;S BOROUGHS</span></h2>

<p>Keutgen (<i>Untersuchungen über den Ursprung der Deutschen

the military origin of the Old Saxon boroughs; and Professor
Maitland saw the applicability of the theory to the boroughs of
Alfred and Edward the Elder. (<i>Domesday Book and Beyond.</i>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
The <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i>, in 894, speaks of &ldquo;the men whose
duty it was to defend the towns&rdquo;; this proves that Alfred had
made some special arrangement for the defence of the towns;
and this arrangement must have been something quite apart
from the ordinary service of the <i>fyrd</i> or militia, which was only
due for a short time. It must have been something permanent,
with an adequate economic basis, such as we have in Henry the
Fowler&rsquo;s plan.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE WORDS &ldquo;CASTRUM&rdquo; AND &ldquo;CASTELLUM&rdquo;</span></h2>

<p>If we take the chroniclers of the reign of Charlemagne and his
successors in the 9th century, we find the word <i>castrum</i>
constantly used for places such as Avignon, Dijon, Macon,
Rheims, Chalons, Cologne, Andernach, Bonn, Coblenz, etc., all
of which are known to have been Roman <i>castra</i>, when there can
be no doubt that the <i>city</i> is meant. Take, for instance, the
<i>Annales Mettenses</i> (Pertz, i., 326), 737: Karl Martel hears that
the Saracens have taken &ldquo;castrum munitissimum Avinionem&rdquo;
(Avignon); he marches against them, and &ldquo;<i>predictam urbem</i>
obsidione circumdat.&rdquo; But these cities are not only called
<i>castra</i>, they are also called <i>castella</i>. Thus the chronicle ascribed
to Hincmar calls Macon both <i>castrum</i> and <i>castellum</i> in the
same breath. (<i>Migne</i>, 125, 1298.) The fortifications built by
Charlemagne against the Saxons are called <i>castra</i>, <i>castella</i>,
and <i>civitates</i>. (<i>Chron. Moissiacense</i>, Pertz, i., 308. <i>Ann.
Einhardi</i>, ibid., 196, 204.) The camps of the Northmen, which
as we have seen, were of great size, are also called not only
<i>castra</i>, but <i>civitates</i>, <i>castella</i>, <i>munitiones</i>, <i>oppida</i>. (<i>Annales
Fuldenses</i>, Pertz, i., 397.) The camp built by Charles the Bald
at Pistes in 868 is called a <i>castellum</i>, though it was evidently
an enclosure of great size, as he measured out quarters in it
for his nobles, and formed an elaborate scheme for its
maintenance. (Hincmar, <i>Migne</i>, 125, 1242, 1244.) Coming to
the 10th century, the following passage from Flodoard will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
show the vagueness of the words in common use for fortifications:
&ldquo;Heribertus Ansellum Bosonis subditum, qui prædictum
custodiebat <i>castrum</i> (Vitry), cum ipso <i>castello</i> recipit, et
Codiacum S. Remigii <i>municipium</i> illi cum alia terra concedit.
Nec longum, Bosonis fideles <i>oppidanorum</i> proditione Victoriacum
(Vitry) recipiunt, et Mosonum fraude pervadunt. At Heribertus,
a quibusdam Mosomensibus evocatus, supervenit
insperatus, et entrans <i>oppidum</i>, porta latenter a <i>civibus</i> aperta,
milites Bosonis, qui ad custodiam loci residebant, ibidem
omnes capit.&rdquo; (<i>Migne</i>, 135, 297.) Here it is clear that <i>castrum</i>,
<i>castellum</i>, <i>municipium</i>, and <i>oppidum</i> all mean the same thing,
and the one word <i>civibus</i> betrays that it is a <i>city</i> which is
meant. Undoubtedly the chronicler thinks it elegant to change
his words as often as he can. <i>Munitio</i> is another word
frequently used; in classical Latin it means a bulwark, a wall
or bank; in the chroniclers of the 10th century it is used
indifferently for a town or castle, though certain passages, such
as &ldquo;subversis multarum munitionibus urbium&rdquo; (Flodoard, i., vi.),
show that the right sense is not far from the mind of the
writer. The numerous passages in which we are told of
monasteries being enclosed with walls and converted into <i>castella</i>,
show that the <i>enclosure</i> is the chief idea which the chroniclers
associate with this word. The citations made above are not
exceptional, but typical, and could be paralleled by countless
others.</p>

<p>Since the above was written, I have read Keutgen&rsquo;s <i>Untersuchungen
über den Ursprung der Deutschen Stadtverfassung</i>.
He remarks that the Latin words for a town (in the 10th and
11th century writers) are <i>urbs</i>, <i>castellum</i>, <i>civitas</i>, sometimes <i>arx</i>;
for a village, <i>villa</i>, <i>oppidum</i>, <i>vicus</i>. This absolutely agrees with
what I have observed in these writers, except that I have
certainly found <i>oppidum</i> used for a town, as in the passage from
Flodoard cited above.</p>

<span class="smaller">THELWALL</span></h2>

<p>A writer in the <i>Manchester Guardian</i> a few years ago
suggested a new solution of the name Thelwall. He believes
that the Thelwall raised by Edward was a boundary wall of
timber, stretching from Thelwall to Runcorn. The Mersey, he
argues, above Thelwall formerly broadened out into a series of
swamps which would effectually defend the frontier towards the
east. But westward from Thelwall there were no such obstacles,
and it is assumed that Edward made a timber wall from
Thelwall to Ethelfleda&rsquo;s fortress at Runcorn. Some support to
this hypothesis is given in the names of places between Thelwall
and Runcorn: Stockton, Walton (twice), Stockham, Walford,
Wallmore, and Wall-hes. Further, when the bed of the Mersey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
was delved for the Ship Canal, discovery was made of &ldquo;a
remarkable series of submerged piles, 9 feet long, arranged in
two parallel ranks which were 30 feet apart. The intervals
between the piles varied, but seem to have averaged 5 to 6 feet.
Between the ranks were diagonal rows of upright stakes, each
stake about 5 feet long, extending from either rank chevron-wise
to the middle and there overlapping, so that the ground-plan
of them makes a kind of herring-bone pattern. By this
plan, anyone passing through would have to make a zigzag
course. In some places sticks and sedges were found interwoven
horizontally with the stakes, a condition of things which
probably obtained throughout the whole series. The tops of the
tallest piles were 10 feet below the present surface of the
ground, which fact goes far toward precluding the possibility
that this elaborate work may have been a fish-weir. The
disposition of the stakes points to a military origin. So
arranged, the advantage they offered to defending forces was
enormous.&rdquo; I think it worth while to reproduce this account,
especially because of the place-names, but those who are learned
in the construction of fish-weirs may perhaps think that the
description will apply to a work of that kind.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE WORD &ldquo;BRETASCHE&rdquo;</span></h2>

<p>This word, which also appears as bretagium, britagium, or
bristega, evidently means a tower, as is clear from the following
passages: Order from King John to erect a <i>mota et bretagium</i>
at Roscrea, in Ireland (Sweetman&rsquo;s <i>Calendar</i>, i., 412); Order by
Henry III. to the dwellers in the Valley of Montgomery &ldquo;quod
sine dilatione motas suas bonis bretaschiis firmari faciant&rdquo;
(<i>Close Rolls</i>, ii., 42); Order that the timber and bretasche of
Nafferton Castle be carried to Newcastle, and the bretasche to
be placed at the gate of the drawbridge <i>in place of the little tower</i>
which fell through defect in its foundations (<i>Close Rolls</i>, i.,
549b).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span></p>

<p>The word is also expressly defined by William the Breton as
a wooden castle: &ldquo;Circuibat castrum ex omni parte, et fabricavit
brestachias duplices per septem loca, <i>castella videlicet lignea</i>
munitissima.&rdquo; (Bouquet, xvii., 78.)</p>

<p>See also Wright, &ldquo;Illustrations of Domestic Architecture,&rdquo;
<i>Arch. Journ.</i>, i., 212 and 301. In these papers it is clear that
&ldquo;breteske&rdquo; means a tower, as there are several pictures of it.
At a later period it seems to have been used for a wooden
balcony made for the purpose of shooting, in the same sense as
the word &ldquo;hurdicium&rdquo;; but I have not met with any instance of
this before the 14th century.</p>

<h2><a name="APPENDIX_H" id="APPENDIX_H">APPENDIX H</a><br />
<span class="smaller">THE WORDS &ldquo;HURDICIUM&rdquo; AND &ldquo;HORDIARI&rdquo;</span></h2>

<p>These words refer to the wooden galleries carried round the
tops of walls, to enable the defenders to throw down big stones
or other missiles on those who were attempting to attack the
foot of the walls. &ldquo;Hurdicia quæ muros tutos reddebant.&rdquo;
(<i>Philippidos</i>, vii., 201; Bouquet, xvii.) The word &ldquo;alures&rdquo; is
sometimes used in the same sense. See a mandamus of Henry
III., cited by Turner, <i>History of Domestic Architecture</i>, i., 198:
&ldquo;To make on the same tower [of London] on the south side, at
the top, deep alures of good and strong timber, entirely and
well covered with lead, through which people can look even to
the foot of the tower, and better defend it, if need may be.&rdquo;
The alures of the castle of Norwich are spoken of as early as
1187, but this mention, and one of the alures round the castle
of Winchester in 1193, are the only ones I find in the 12th
century in England.</p>

<span class="smaller">&ldquo;HERICIO, ERICIO, HERITO, HERISSON&rdquo;</span></h2>

<p>This is derived from the French word <i>hérisson</i>, a hedgehog,
and should mean something bristling, perhaps with thorns or
osiers. Several passages show that it was a defence on the
counterscarp of the ditch, and it may sometimes have been a
hedge. Cohausen, <i>Befestigungen der Vorzeit</i>, shows that hedges
were frequently used in early fortifications (pp. 8-13). The
following passages seem to show clearly that it was on the
counterscarp of the ditch: &ldquo;[Montreuil] il a bien clos, esforce
e ferme de pel e <i>hericon</i>.&rdquo; (Wace, 107.) &ldquo;Reparato exterioris
Ardensis munitionis valli fossato et amplificato, et sepibus et
ericiis consepto et constipato.&rdquo; (Lambert of Ardres, 623, <i>circa</i>
1117.) The French poem of Jordan Fantosme, describing the
siege of Wark by the Scots in 1174, says the Scots attacked
and carried the <i>hericon</i>, and got into the ditch, but they could
not take the bayle, <i>i.e.</i>, they could not get over the palicium.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE CASTLE OF YALE</span></h2>

<p>In the year 1693, the antiquary Edward Llwyd was sitting
on the motte of Tomen y Rhoddwy engaged in making a very
bad plan of the castle [published in <i>Arch. Camb.</i>, N.S., ii., 57].
His guide told him that he had heard his grandfather say that
two earls used to live there. Llwyd called the guide an
ignorant fellow. Modern traditions are generally the work of
some antiquary who has succeeded in planting his theories
locally; but here we have a tradition of much earlier date
than the time when antiquaries began to sow tares, and
such traditions have usually a shred of truth in them. Is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
it possible that this castle of Tomen y Rhoddwy and the
neighbouring one of Llanarmon were built by the earls of
Chester and Shrewsbury, who certainly went on expeditions
together against Wales, and appear to have divided their
conquests? It is to be noted that the township is called
<i>Bodigre yr Yarll</i>, the township of the earls.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE CASTLE OF TULLOW OR &ldquo;COLLACHT,&rdquo; <a href="#Page_335">p. 335</a></span></h2>

<p>This information is kindly supplied by Mr Goddard H.
Orpen, who writes to me: &ldquo;I visited Tullow lately, and asked
myself where would a Norman erect a mote, and I had no
difficulty in answering: on the high ground near where the
Protestant church stands. When I got up there the first thing
that I noticed was that the church stood on a platform of earth
10 to 14 feet higher than the road, and that this platform was
held in position by a strong retaining wall, well battered
towards the bottom on one side. I then found on enquiry that
the hill on which it stood and the place to the N.W. of it
was called the &lsquo;Castle Hill.&rsquo; On going round to the N.W.
of the church I found a horseshoe-shaped space, scarped all
round to a height of 6 to 10 feet, and rising to about 16 feet
above the adjoining fields. There is no doubt that this was the
site of the castle, and that it was artificially raised. To my
mind there was further little doubt that it represented an
earlier mote. In a field adjoining on the W. I could detect a
platform of about 50 to 70 paces, with traces of a fosse round
the three outer sides.... This was certainly the Castellum de
Tulach mentioned in the deeds concerning Raymond le Gros&rsquo;
grant to the Abbey of St Thomas.&mdash;<i>Dublin Reg. St Thomas</i>, pp.
111, 113.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr Westropp says that the &ldquo;great earthworks and fosses&rdquo;
on the Hill of Slane are mentioned in the &ldquo;Life of St Patrick&rdquo;
(<i>Journ. R. S. A. I.</i>, 1904, p. 313). What the <i>Life</i> really says is:
&ldquo;They came to Ferta Fer Fiecc,&rdquo; which is translated &ldquo;the graves
of Fiacc&rsquo;s men&rdquo;; and the notes of Muirchu Maccu-Machtheni
add, &ldquo;which, as fables say, were dug by the slaves of Feccol
Ferchertni, one of the nine Wizards&rdquo; (<i>Tripartite Life</i>, p. 278).
It does not mention any fort, or even a hill, and though Ferta
Fer Fiecc is identified with Slane, there is nothing to show
what part of Slane it was.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE WORD &ldquo;DONJON&rdquo;</span></h2>

<p>Professor Skeat and <i>The New English Dictionary</i> derive this
word from the Low Latin, <i>dominionem</i>, acc. of <i>dominio</i>, lordship.
Leland frequently speaks of the keep as the dungeon, which of
course is the same word. Its modern use for a subterranean
prison seems to have arisen when the keeps were abandoned
for more spacious and comfortable habitations by the noble
owners, and were chiefly used as prisons. The word <i>dunio</i>, which,
as we have seen, Lambert of Ardres used for a motte, probably
comes from a different root, cognate with the Anglo-Saxon
<i>dun</i>, a hill, and used in Flanders for the numerous sandhills of
that coast.</p>

<h2><a name="APPENDIX_O" id="APPENDIX_O">APPENDIX O</a><br />
<span class="smaller">THE ARRANGEMENTS IN EARLY KEEPS</span></h2>

<p>We get a glimpse of these in a story given in the &ldquo;Gesta
Ambasiensium Dominorum,&rdquo; D&rsquo;Archery, <i>Spicilegium</i>, 278.
Sulpicius the Treasurer of the Abbey of St Martin at Tours,
an important personage, built a stone keep at Amboise in 1015
(<i>Chron. Turonense Magnum</i>), in place of the &ldquo;wooden house&rdquo;
which his brother had held. In the time of Fulk Rechin
(1066-1106), this keep was in the hands of the adherents of
the counts of Blois. Hugh, son of Sulpicius, with two other
men, hid themselves by night in the basement, which was used
as a storehouse; it must therefore have had an entrance from
outside. With the help of ropes, they climbed up a sewer into
the bedchamber, which was above the cellar, and evidently had
no stair communicating with the cellar. Here they found the
lady of the house and two maids sleeping, and a watchman who
was also asleep. While one of the men held these in terror
with a drawn sword, the other two climbed up a ladder and
through a trap-door up to the roof of the tower, where they
unfurled the banner of Hugh. Here we see a very simple
keep, which has only one storey above the basement; this may
have been divided into two or more apartments, but it was
thought a fitting residence for a lady of rank. It had no
stairs, but all the communications were by trap-doors and
ladders. We may be quite sure that the people of rank of the
11th and 12th centuries were content with much rougher
accommodation than Mr Clark imagined. Even Richard I.&rsquo;s
much admired keep of Chateau Gaillard appears to have had
no communication but ladders between the floors.</p>

<span class="smaller">KEEPS AS RESIDENCES</span></h2>

<p>The description of a keep which we have already given from
Lambert of Ardres (Chap. VI.) is sufficient to prove that even
wooden keeps in the 12th century were used as permanent
residences, and this is confirmed by many scattered notices in
the various chronicles of France and England. It was not till
late in the 13th century that the desire for more comfortable
rooms led to the building of chambers in the courtyard.</p>

<span class="smaller">CASTLES BUILT BY HENRY I.</span></h2>

<p>The castles, which according to Robert de Monte, Henry I.
built altogether [<i>ex integro</i>] were Drincourt, Chateauneuf-sur-Epte,
Verneuil, Nonancourt, Bonmoulins, Colmemont,
Pontorson, St Denis-en-Lyons, and Vaudreuil. Many of these
may have been wooden castles; Chateauneuf-sur-Epte almost
certainly was; it has now a <i>round</i> donjon on a motte. The
&ldquo;Tour Grise&rdquo; at Verneuil is certainly not the work of Henry I.,
but belongs to the 13th century.</p>

<h2><a name="APPENDIX_R" id="APPENDIX_R">APPENDIX R</a><br />
<span class="smaller">THE SO-CALLED SHELL KEEP</span></h2>

<p>We have three accounts of motte-castles from the 12th
century: that of Alexander Neckham, in the treatise <i>De
Utensilibus</i>; that of Laurence of Durham, cited in Chapter VII.,
<a href="#Page_147">p. 147</a>; and the well-known description of the castle of Marchem,
also cited in Chapter VI., <a href="#Page_88">p. 88</a>. All these three describe the
top of the motte as surrounded by a wall (of course of wood),
within which is built a wooden tower. The account of Marchem
says that it was built in the middle of the area. This supports
the conjecture in the text. Mr H. E. Malden has shown (<i>Surrey
Archæolog. Collections</i>, xvi., 28) that the keep of Guildford is of
later date than the stone wall round the top of the motte.
Remove this tower, and there would be what is commonly called
a shell keep. It would appear, therefore, that it was a common
practice to change the bank or stockade round the top of the
motte into a stone wall (no doubt as a defence against fire),
leaving the keep inside still of wood. Four of the pictures from
the Bayeux Tapestry (see <a href="#Frontispiece">Frontispiece</a>) all give the idea of a
wooden tower inside a stockade on a motte.</p>

<h2><a name="APPENDIX_S" id="APPENDIX_S">APPENDIX S</a><br />
<span class="smaller">PROFESSOR LLOYD&rsquo;S &ldquo;HISTORY OF WALES&rdquo;</span></h2>

<p>I regret that this valuable work did not appear until too late
for me to make use of it in my chapter on Welsh Castles. It is
worth while to note the following points in which Professor
Lloyd&rsquo;s conclusions differ from or confirm those which I have
been led to adopt.</p>

<p>Aberystwyth and Aberrheiddiol.&mdash;&ldquo;After the destruction of
the last Aberystwyth Castle of the older situation in 1143, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
chief stronghold of the district was moved to the mouth of the
Rheiddiol, a position which it ever afterwards retained, though
people still insisted on calling it Aberystwyth&rdquo; (514). &ldquo;The
original castle of Aberystwyth crowned the slight eminence at
the back of the farm of Tan y Castell, which lies in the Ystwyth
valley 1&frac12; miles S. of the town. There is the further evidence of
the name, and the earthworks still visible on the summit&rdquo; (426,
<i>note</i>).</p>

<p>Carreghova.&mdash;I ought perhaps to have included this castle in
my list, though on the actual map its site is within the English
border; but as there are absolutely no remains of it [D. H. M.]
it does not affect the question I am discussing.</p>

<p>Cardigan and Cilgerran.&mdash;&ldquo;Dingeraint cannot be Cilgerran,
because Cilgerran is derived from <i>Cerran</i>, with the feminine
inflection, not from <i>Geraint</i>; nor is Cilgerran &lsquo;close to the fall
of the Teifi into the sea,&rsquo; as the chronicler says Dingeraint was.
The castle built by Earl Roger was probably Cardigan&rdquo; (401).
Professor Lloyd afterwards identifies Cilgerran with the castle
of Emlyn (661). This seems to me questionable, as the &ldquo;New
Castle of Emlyn,&rdquo; first mentioned in Edward I.&rsquo;s reign, presupposes
an older castle, and as I have stated, a mound answering
to the older castle still exists not far from the stone castle.</p>

<p>Carmarthen.&mdash;Professor Lloyd thinks this castle stood at the
present farm of Rhyd y Gors, about a mile below the town; but
I see no reason to alter the conclusion to which I was led by
Mr Floyd&rsquo;s paper, that the Rhyd y Gors of the castle was a ford
at Carmarthen itself. The fact that Henry I. founded a cell to
Battle Abbey at Carmarthen (431) seems to me an additional
piece of evidence that the castle was there; castle and abbey
nearly always went together.</p>

<p>Dinweiler.&mdash;Professor Lloyd assumes Dinweiler to be the
same as the castle in Mabudryd built by Earl Gilbert, and to be
situated at or near Pencader (501). It should be noted, however,
that Dinweiler reads Dinefor in MS. B. of the <i>Brut</i>, in 1158. I
am in error in supposing St Clair to be the castle of Mabudryd
(following a writer in <i>Archæologia Cambrensis</i>), as St Clair is
not in that commote. Professor Lloyd&rsquo;s map of the <i>cantrefs</i> and
<i>commotes</i> differs widely from that of previous writers.</p>

<p>Llangadoc.&mdash;&ldquo;Luchewein&rdquo; should not be identified with this
castle; Professor Lloyd thinks it may refer to a castle at Llwch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
Owain, a lake in the parish of Llanarthney, where there is an
entrenchment known as Castell y Garreg.</p>

<p>Maud&rsquo;s Castle.&mdash;Camden identified &ldquo;Matildis castrum&rdquo; with
Colewent or Colwyn, but Professor Lloyd is of opinion that &ldquo;a
careful collation of the English and Welsh authorities for the
events of the years 1198 and 1231 will make it clear that
Payne&rsquo;s Castle and Maud&rsquo;s Castle are the same.&rdquo; This of
course does not affect what is said about Colwyn Castle in the
text.</p>

<p>Montgomery.&mdash;Professor Lloyd deems that the emphasis
laid (especially in the <i>Charter Rolls</i>, i., 101) on the fact that the
building of Henry III.&rsquo;s reign was New Montgomery, leaves no
doubt that the former town and castle stood elsewhere, probably
at Hên Domen. This, if true, would greatly strengthen my
case, as Hên Domen is an admirable motte and bailey.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_15" id="Footnote_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> Some writers give the name of moot-hill to places in Yorkshire and
elsewhere where the older ordnance maps give moat-hill. <i>Moat</i> in this
connection is the same as <i>motte</i>, the Scotch and Irish <i>mote</i>, i.e., the hillock
of a castle, derived from the Norman-French word <i>motte</i>. As this word is
by far the most convenient name to give to these hillocks, being the only
specific name which they have ever had, we shall henceforth use it in these
pages. We prefer it to <i>mote</i>, which is the Anglicised form of the word,
because of its confusion with <i>moat</i>, a ditch. Some writers advocate the
word <i>mount</i>, but this appears to us too vague. As the word <i>motte</i> is French
in origin, it appropriately describes a thing which was very un-English
when first introduced here.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_16" id="Footnote_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> At York, a prehistoric crouching skeleton was found by Messrs Benson
and Platnauer when excavating the castle hill in 1903, 4 feet 6 inches below
the level of the ground. The motte at York appears to have been raised
after the destruction of the first castle, but whether the first hillock belonged
to the ancient burial is not decided by the account, &ldquo;Notes on Clifford&rsquo;s
Tower,&rdquo; by the above authors. <i>Trans. York. Philosoph. Soc.</i>, 1902. Another
instance is recorded in the <i>Revue Archæologique</i>, to which we have
unfortunately lost the reference.</p></div>

the thing and its name as something distinctly French: &ldquo;munitiones quas

England seem to have been new inventions in Normandy itself. William
of Jumièges distinctly makes the building of castles to have been one of the
main signs and causes of the general disorder of the days of William&rsquo;s
minority, and he seems to speak of the practice as something new.&rdquo; <i>N. C.</i>,

should have fallen under the influence of Mr Clark&rsquo;s <i>burh</i> theory, and should

borough was 1400 yards from the Trent at its nearest point, and that the
highest ground on the south side of the Trent is marked by the Trent
Bridge cricket ground, the last spot to become flooded. Here, therefore,
was the probable site of Edward&rsquo;s second borough.</p></div>

Venantius Fortunatus, in his descriptive poem, tells us that it was a vast
enclosure with no less than thirty towers, built by the good pastor for the
protection of his flock. It even contained fields and vineyards, and
altogether was as different from a private castle as anything can well be.
Similarly the <i>castrum</i> of Merliac, spoken of by Enlart (<i>Architecture Militaire</i>,
p. 492) as a &ldquo;veritable château,&rdquo; is described as containing cultivated lands and
sheets of water! (Cited from Gregory of Tours, <i>Hist. Francorum</i>, liii., 13.)
De Caumont himself says: &ldquo;Les grandes exploitations rurales que possédaient
les rois de France et les principaux du royaume du V<sup>ième</sup> au X<sup>ième</sup> siècle

or general&rsquo;s quarters in the Roman <i>castra</i>. It is far more probable that they
were derived from mural towers. The Pretorium was not originally fortified,
and it was placed in the centre of the Roman camp. But one great object
of the feudal keep was to have communication with the open country. The
keep of Laon was certainly on the line of the walls, as Bishop Ascelin
escaped from it down a rope in 989, and got away on a horse which was
waiting for him. Palgrave, <i>England and Normandy</i>, ii., 880.</p></div>

d&rsquo;Archæologie Française</i>, ii., 495, has been misled about this castle by the
<i>Chronicon Andegavense</i>, which says: &ldquo;Odo.... Fulconem expugnare
speravit, et totis nisibus adorsus est. Annoque presenti (1025) Montis Budelli
castellum, quod circiter annos decem retro abhinc contra civitatem Turonicam
firmaverat Fulco, obsedit, et turrim ligneam miræ altitudinis super
domgionem ipsius castri erexit.&rdquo; Bouquet, x., 176. M. Enlart takes this to
be the first recorded instance of a motte. But the passage is evidently
corrupt, as the other accounts of this affair show that Count Odo&rsquo;s wooden
tower was a siege engine, employed to attack Fulk&rsquo;s castle, and afterwards
burnt by the besieged. See the <i>Gesta Ambasiens. Dom.</i>, <i>ibid.</i>, p. 257, and
the <i>Chron. St Florentii</i>. Probably we should read <i>contra</i> domgionem
instead of <i>super</i>. The <i>Chronicon Andegavense</i> was written in the reign of
Henry II.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_194" id="Footnote_194"></a><a href="#FNanchor_194"><span class="label">[194]</span></a> <i>Dunio</i> is subsequently explained by Lambert as <i>motte</i>: &ldquo;Motam altissimam
sive dunionem eminentem in munitionis signum firmavit.&rdquo; <i>Lamberti
Ardensis</i>, p. 613. It is the same word as the Saxon <i>dun</i>, a hill (preserved
in our South Downs), and has no connection with the Irish and Gaelic <i>dun</i>,
which is cognate with the German <i>zaun</i>, a hedge, A.-S. <i>tun</i>, and means a
hedged or fortified place. The form <i>dange</i> appears in Northern France,
and this seems to be the origin of the word <i>domgio</i> or <i>dangio</i> which we find
in the chroniclers, the modern form of which is <i>donjon</i>. If we accept this
etymology, we must believe that the word <i>dunio</i> or <i>domgio</i> was originally
applied to the hill, and not to the tower on the hill, to which it was afterwards
transferred. It is against this view that Ordericus, writing some fifty
years before Lambert, uses the form <i>dangio</i> in the sense of a tower. Professor
Skeat and the <i>New English Dictionary</i> derive the word <i>donjon</i> or
<i>dungeon</i> from Low Lat. <i>domnionem</i>, acc. of <i>domnio</i>, thus connecting it
with <i>dominus</i>, as the seignorial residence.</p></div>

those we have described already. Thus the castle of the great family of
Montgomeri is an enclosure of this simple kind. Domfront, built by
William Talvas in Duke Robert&rsquo;s time, has no motte. On the other hand,
Ivry, built by the Countess Albereda in Duke Richard I.&rsquo;s days, &ldquo;on the
top of a hill overlooking the town&rdquo; (William of Jumièges), may possibly
have been a motte; and there is a motte at Norrei, which we have just

of France. The late M. Mortillet, in an article in the <i>Revue Mensuelle de
l&rsquo;École d&rsquo;Anthropologie</i>, viii., 1895, published two lists, one of actual mottes
in France, the other of place-names in which the word motte is incorporated.
Unfortunately the first list is extremely defective, and the second, as it only
relates to the name, is not a safe guide to the proportional numbers of the
thing. All that the lists prove is that mottes are to be found in all parts of
France, and that place-names into which the word <i>motte</i> enters seem to be
more abundant in Central France than anywhere else. It is possible that a
careful examination of local chroniclers may lead to the discovery of some
earlier motte-builder than Thibault-le-Tricheur. We should probably know
more about Thibault&rsquo;s castles were it not that the Pays Chartrain, as
Palgrave says, is almost destitute of chroniclers.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_327" id="Footnote_327"></a><a href="#FNanchor_327"><span class="label">[327]</span></a> Mr Clark thought there was another motte in the earthworks outside
the walls, though he expresses himself doubtfully: &ldquo;I rather think they [the
mounds outside the city ditch] or one of them, looked rather like a moated
mound, but I could not feel sure of it.&ldquo; <i>Arch. Cantiana</i>, xv., 344. Gostling
(<i>A Walk about Canterbury</i>, 1825) says there were <i>two</i>, which is perhaps
explained by a passage in Brayley&rsquo;s <i>Kent</i> (1808), in which he describes the
external fortification as &ldquo;a lesser mount, now divided into two parts, with a
ditch and embankment.&rdquo; P. 893. Stukeley&rsquo;s description (circa 1700) is as
follows: &ldquo;Within the walls is a very high mount, called Dungeon Hill; a
ditch and high bank enclose the area before it; it seems to have been part
of the old castle. Opposite to it without the walls is a hill, seeming to have
been raised by the Danes when they besieged the city. The top of the
Dungeon Hill is equal to the top of the castle.&rdquo; <i>Itin. Curiosum</i>, i., 122. It
is of course not impossible that there may have been two mottes to this
castle, as at Lewes and Lincoln, but such instances are rare, and it seems
more likely that a portion of the bailey bank which happened to be in better
preservation and consequently higher was mistaken for another mount. Mr
Clark committed this very error at Tadcaster, and the other writers we have
quoted were quite untrained as observers of earthen castles. At any rate
there can be no doubt that the Dane John is the original chief citadel of this
castle, as the statements of Somner, Stukeley, and we may add, Leland, are
explicit. The most ancient maps of Canterbury, Hoefnagel&rsquo;s (1570), Smith&rsquo;s
(<i>Description of England</i>, 1588), and Grose&rsquo;s (1785), all show the Dungeon
Hill within the walls, but take no notice of the outwork outside.</p></div>

The latter extract, which refers to the provisioning of the keep, seems to
show that it was then finished. The sums put down to the castle, amounting
to about £4000 of our money, are not sufficient to defray the cost of so fine
a keep. But the entries in the <i>Pipe Rolls</i> relate only to the Sheriff&rsquo;s
accounts, and it is probable that the cost of the keep was largely paid out
of the revenues of the archbishopric, which Henry seized into his own hands
during the Becket quarrel.</p></div>

extends from Northgate to the Castle, and is roughly semicircular in plan.
In the middle of it was St George&rsquo;s Gate, which was anciently called
<i>Newingate</i> (Gostling, p. 53) and may possibly have been Henry II.&rsquo;s new
gate. The part enclosing the Dungeon Hill is angular, and appeared to
Mr Clark, as well as to Somner and Hasted, to have been brought out at
this angle in order to enclose the hill.</p></div>

but £100 entered same year for the works of the castle. There is no
mention of stone for the castle during these two reigns, but after the death
of John we find that works are going on at Dover for which kilns are
required. (<i>Close Rolls</i>, i., 352, 1218.) This entry is followed by a very
large expenditure on Dover Castle (amounting to at least £6000), sufficient
to cover the cost of a stone wall and towers round the outer circuit. The
orders of planks for joists must be for the towers, and the large quantities of
lead, for roofing them. The order for timber &ldquo;ad palum et alia facienda&rdquo;
in 1225 <i>may</i> refer to a stockade on the advanced work called the Spur,
which is said to be Hubert&rsquo;s work. (<i>Close Rolls</i>, ii., 14.)</p></div>

the king should deliver to him the castle of Tickhill; then the king was to
have the city and castle of Lincoln again, excepting the earl&rsquo;s own tower,
which his mother had fortified. His mother was Lucy, daughter of Ivo
Taillebois; and as the principal tower was known as the Luce Tower,
the masonry may have been her work. In that case the Norman work
on the smaller motte may be due to Ralph Gernon, and may possibly be
the <i>nova turris</i> which was repaired in John&rsquo;s reign. <i>Pipe Roll</i>, 2 John.

But round arches are by no means conclusive evidence in themselves
of Norman date, and the size of these windows, as well as the
absence of buttresses, and the presence of pointed arches, are quite
incompatible with the early Norman period. The whole architecture of
the castle agrees with a 14th century date, to which the chapel undoubtedly
belongs.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_564" id="Footnote_564"></a><a href="#FNanchor_564"><span class="label">[564]</span></a> There are similar nook-shafts to Henry II.&rsquo;s keep at Scarborough, and
to Castle Rising. Mr Hartshorne (<i>Arch. Journ.</i>, v., 207) thought that
there had been an earlier stone keep at Peak Castle, because some moulded
stones are used in the walls, and because there is some herring-bone work in
the basement. But this herring-bone work only occurs in a revetment wall
to the rock in the cellar; and the moulded stones may be quite modern
insertions for repairs, and may have come from the oratory in the N.E.
angle, or from some of the ruined windows and doorways. The sums
entered to this castle between the years 1172 and 1176 are less than half the
cost of Scarborough keep, and do not appear adequate, though the keep was
a small one. But there is some reason to think that the cost of castles was
occasionally defrayed in part from sources not entered in the <i>Pipe Rolls</i>.</p></div>

Burhs and Early Norman Castles,&rdquo; the present writer was misled into
the statement that this hut was the remains of the cellar of the Norman
<i>bretasche</i>. A subsequent study of Mr Hardwick&rsquo;s more lucid account of
the excavations showed that this was an error. There were two pavements
of boulders, one on the natural surface of the hill, on which the hut had
been built, the other 5 feet above it, and 12 feet below the present
surface. The hut appeared to have been circular, with wattled walls and a
thatched roof. Several objects were found in its remains, and were pronounced
to be Roman or Romano-British. The upper pavement would
probably be the flooring of a Norman keep.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_571" id="Footnote_571"></a><a href="#FNanchor_571"><span class="label">[571]</span></a> Mr Roach Smith pronounced this spur to be Norman. As its evidence
is so important, it is to be regretted that its position was not more accurately
observed. It was found in the lowest stratum of the remains, but Mr
Hardwick says: &ldquo;As it was not observed until thrown to the surface, a
possibility remained that it might have fallen from the level of the upper
boulder pavement, 5 feet higher.&rdquo; We may regard this possibility as a
certainty, if the lower hut was really British.</p></div>

Mr Freeman and others have noticed that the special mention of a <i>stone</i>
castle makes it probable that the first castle was of wood. Mr Round
remarks that the building of Rochester Castle is fixed, by the conjunction of
William II. and Lanfranc in its history, to some date between September
1087 and March 1089. <i>Geoffrey de Mandeville</i>, p. 339. Probably, therefore,
it was this new castle which Bishop Odo held against Rufus in 1088.

also says &ldquo;idem episcopus turrim egregiam ædificavit.&rdquo; Both passages are

British fortifications, in that the rampart is of the same height all round,
instead of being lower where the ground is steeper; this led him to think
that the original fortress had been modernised in later times. Sir Richard
Colt Hoare noticed that the ramparts of Sarum were twice as high as those
of the fine prehistoric camps with which he was acquainted. <i>Ancient

and takes it to mean that the castle was built on land in the borough
of Stafford belonging to the manor of Chebsey. But he himself
says that &ldquo;the site of Stafford Castle, within the liberties, though not
within the borough of Stafford, would suggest a royal foundation&rdquo;; and
he believes this castle (the one on the motte) to have been the one
garrisoned by Henry I. and made a residence by Henry II. <i>Domesday

in most of the works which call themselves Histories of the Tower of
London. The plan of these works generally is to skim over the structural
history as quickly as possible, perhaps with the help of a few passages from
Clark, and to get on to the history of the prisoners in the Tower. For the
description in the text, the writer is greatly indebted to Mr Harold Sands,

upon it, it is hoped, will shortly appear.</p></div>

served as banqueting halls, and it is a point of some difficulty whether they
were built to be used as such. But as late as the 14th century, Piers
Ploughman rebukes the new custom which was growing up of the noble and
his family taking their meals in private, and leaving the hall to their retainers.
Every castle seems to have had a hall in the bailey.</p></div>

the solid base of a Roman mural tower. But this keep is quite an exceptional
building. See <i>Excavations at Pevensey</i>, Second Report, by H. Sands.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_722" id="Footnote_722"></a><a href="#FNanchor_722"><span class="label">[722]</span></a> Mr Sands has conjectured that the third floor may be an addition, and
that the second storey was originally open up to the roof and not communicating
with the mural passage except by stairs. This was actually the
case at Bamborough keep, and at Newcastle and Rochester the mural
gallery opens into the upper part of the second storey by inner windows.</p></div>

Under the year 1193, after relating the tragedy of the Jews at York Castle,
Hoveden says: &ldquo;Deinde idem cancellarius [William de Longchamp] tradidit
Osberto de Lunchamp, fratri suo, comitatum Eboracensem in custodia, et
precepit firmari castellum in veteri castellario quod Rex Willelmus Rufus
ibi construxerat.&rdquo; III., 34, R. S. The expression <i>vetus castellarium</i> would
lead us to think of the Old Baile, which certainly had this name from an
early period; and Hoveden, being a Yorkshireman as well as a very
accurate writer, was probably aware of the difference between the two
castles. But if he meant the Old Baile, then both the castles were restored
at about the same time. &ldquo;Rufus&rdquo; must be a slip, unless there was some
rebuilding in Rufus&rsquo; reign of which we do not know.</p></div>

<i>Pipe Roll</i>, 19 Henry III. It is, of course, a conjecture that this accident
happened to the keep; but the keep would be the part most exposed to the
wind, and the <i>scattering</i> of the timber, so that it had to be collected, is just
what would happen if a timber structure were blown off a motte.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_808" id="Footnote_808"></a><a href="#FNanchor_808"><span class="label">[808]</span></a> As the writer was the first to publish this statement, it will be well to
give the evidence on which it rests. The keep of York is clearly Early
English in style, and of an early phase of the style. It is, however, evident
to every one who has carefully compared our dated keeps, that castle
architecture always lags behind church architecture in style-development,
and must be judged by different standards. We should therefore be
prepared to find this and most other keeps to be of later date than their
architecture would suggest. Moreover, the expenditure entered to York
Castle in the reigns of Henry II., Richard I., and John, is quite insufficient
to cover the cost of a stone keep. The <i>Pipe Rolls</i> of Henry III.&rsquo;s reign
decide the matter, as they show the sums which he expended annually on
this castle. It is true they never mention the <i>turris</i>, but always the
<i>castrum</i>; we must also admit that the <i>turris</i> and <i>castrum</i> are often distinguished
in the writs, even as late as Edward III.&rsquo;s reign. (<i>Close Rolls</i>,
1334.) On the other hand extensive acquaintance with the <i>Pipe Rolls</i>
proves that though the mediæval scribe may have an occasional fit of
accuracy, he is generally very loose in his use of words, and his distinctions
must never be pressed. Take, for instance, the case of Orford,
where the word used in the <i>Pipe Rolls</i> is always <i>castellum</i>, but it certainly
refers to the keep, as there are no other buildings at Orford. Other
instances might be given in which the word <i>castellum</i> clearly applies to
the keep. It should be mentioned that in 1204 John gave an order for
stone for the castle (<i>Close Rolls</i>, i., 4b), but the amounts on the bill for
it in the <i>Pipe Rolls</i> show that it was not used for any extensive building

Montacute Castle was given to the Cluniac monks (<i>ante</i>, <a href="#Page_170">p. 170</a>). Thicket
Priory, in Yorkshire, occupied the site of the castle of Wheldrake; and
William de Albini gave the site and materials of the old castle of Buckenham,
in Norfolk, to the new castle which he founded there. The materials, but
not the site, of the wooden castle of Montferrand were given in Stephen&rsquo;s
reign to Meaux Abbey, and served to build some of the monastic offices.

MS. is not earlier than the 14th century it would be idle to claim this as a
proof of the existence of a castle at this period. <i>Castell</i>, in Welsh, is
believed to have come straight from the Latin, and was applied to any kind
of fortress. Lloyd, <i>Welsh Place-names</i>, &ldquo;Y Cymmrodor,&rdquo; xi., 28.</p></div>

as shown by Dr Christison&rsquo;s map, in the shires which made up ancient
Galloway (Wigton, Kirkcudbright, and Dumfries) with the savage resistance
offered by Galloway, which may have made it necessary for all the Norman
under-tenants to fortify themselves, each in his own motte-castle. It is
wiser, however, to delay such speculations until we have the more exact
information as to the number of mottes in Scotland, which it is hoped
will be furnished when the Royal Commission on Historical Monuments has
finished its work. But this work will not be complete unless special attention
is paid to the earthworks which now form part of stone castles, and
which are too often overlooked, even by antiquaries. The <i>New Statistical
Account</i> certainly raises the suspicion that there are many more mottes north
of the Forth than are recognised in the map alluded to. In one district we
are told that &ldquo;almost every farm had its <i>knap</i>.&rdquo; &ldquo;Forfarshire,&rdquo; p. 326.</p></div>

<i>raths</i>, of which such immense numbers are still to be found in Ireland. By
the &ldquo;walled castles&rdquo; he probably meant the stone enclosures or <i>cashels</i>
which are also so numerous in Ireland. In the time of Giraldus the word
<i>castellum</i>, though it had become the proper word for a private castle, had
not quite lost its original sense of a fortified enclosure of any kind, as we
know from the phrases &ldquo;the castle and tower&rdquo; or &ldquo;the castle and motte&rdquo;
not infrequent in documents of the 12th century (see Round&rsquo;s <i>Geoffrey de
Mandeville</i>, Appendix O, <a href="#Page_328">p. 328</a>). We may add that Giraldus&rsquo; attribution
of these prehistoric remains to Thorgils, the Norwegian, only shows that
their origin was unknown in his day.</p></div>

the details, such as the corbelled lintel, the window benches, and the loop

the north of the cathedral, is a fragment of an ancient tower, built of the
rudest rubble, with small quoins of ashlar; this may be the keep built by
William I., which Wace says was of stone and lime (p. 234, Andresen&rsquo;s

This makes it almost certain that the castle of Wark was entirely rebuilt at
this time, after having been demolished by the Scots in 1460. It is now an

castle of Chatillon to be &ldquo;hoarded&rdquo; (hordiari). This duke had been a
companion of Richard&rsquo;s on the third crusade. William le Breton, <i>Philippides</i>,
line 600. Richard&rsquo;s <i>hurdicia</i> at Chateau Gaillard were two years earlier.</p></div>

holes in which the wooden beams supporting the hurdicia were placed may
still be seen in many English castles, and so may the remains of the stone
brackets. They would be good indications of date, were it not that hurdicia
could so easily be added to a much older building.</p></div>

so early a date. The decorative features appear early, but the second and
third storeys are both vaulted, which is a late sign. The keep called
Clifford&rsquo;s Tower at York, built by Henry III. 1245 to 1259, is on the same
plan as Étampes.</p></div>

(almost certainly an addition of Henry I.&rsquo;s time), Bamborough (probably
Henry II.&rsquo;s reign), and Richmond, where Earl Conan seems to have used a
former entrance gateway to make the basement entrance of his keep. See

external enclosure but a moat. Flint has a great tower outside the quadrangle,
which is sometimes mistakenly called a keep, but its internal
arrangements show that it was not so, and it is doubtful whether it was ever
roofed over. It was simply a tower to protect the entrance, taking the
place of the 13th-century barbican.</p></div>

Germany, built in 1224. <i>Kriegswesen</i>, iii., 475. Frederic II.&rsquo;s castles were
of this type. The castle of Boulogne, finished in 1231, is one of the oldest
examples of the keepless type in France. Enlart, <i>Archæologie Française</i>,
ii., 534. The Bastille of Paris was a castle of this kind. According to
Hartshorne, Barnwell Castle, in Northants, is of the keepless kind, and as
the <i>Hundred Rolls</i> state that it was built in 1264, we seem to have here a
positive instance of a keepless castle in Henry III.&rsquo;s reign. <i>Arch. Inst.
Newcastle</i>, vol. 1852. And it appears to be certain that Gilbert de Clare,
Earl of Gloucester, built the keepless castle of Caerphilly before Edward
came to the throne. See Little&rsquo;s <i>Mediæval Wales</i>, p. 87.</p></div>

the Isle of Man, are the only other instances known to the writer. Trim is
a square tower with square turrets in the middle of each face; Castle
Rushen is on the same plan, but the central part appears to have been an
open court.</p></div>

castle is actually a fortification with three banks: one round the top of the
motte, one round the edge of the bailey, one on the counterscarp of the ditch.</p></div>
